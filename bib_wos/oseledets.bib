Abstract = {{Spatial soil sampling is an integral part of a soil survey aimed at
   describing spatial variability in soil properties. We propose
   considering the soil sampling procedure as a task of optimal design. In
   practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce experimentation costs,
   as they allow the researcher to obtain one optimal set of points.
   We present a sampling design, based on the fundamental idea of selecting
   sample locations with the most significant dissimilarities. The proposed
   sampling design is founded upon an optimal design method called the
   maxvol algorithm. The sampling design is tested in three real cases
   differing in field data availability and compared to the popular
   sampling schemes - simple random sampling, conditional Latin Hypercube,
   Kennard-Stone and stratified random sampling based on complex
   geographical strata.
   It is shown that the maxvol-base algorithm has a high potential for
   practical usage. Our method outperforms popular sampling methods in soil
   taxa prediction based on topographical features of the site. The
   proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for practical
   application because it can produce high-quality sampling scheme with
   very few points.}},

Title = {{Generation of the NIR Spectral Band for Satellite Images with
   Convolutional Neural Networks}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The near-infrared (NIR) spectral range (from 780 to 2500 nm) of the
   multispectral remote sensing imagery provides vital information for
   landcover classification, especially concerning vegetation assessment.
   Despite the usefulness of NIR, it does not always accomplish common RGB.
   Modern achievements in image processing via deep neural networks make it
   possible to generate artificial spectral information, for example, to
   solve the image colorization problem. In this research, we aim to
   investigate whether this approach can produce not only visually similar
   images but also an artificial spectral band that can improve the
   performance of computer vision algorithms for solving remote sensing
   tasks. We study the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
   approach in the task of the NIR band generation using only RGB channels
   of high-resolution satellite imagery. We evaluate the impact of a
   generated channel on the model performance to solve the forest
   segmentation task. Our results show an increase in model accuracy when
   using generated NIR compared to the baseline model, which uses only RGB
   (0.947 and 0.914 F1-scores, respectively). The presented study shows the
   advantages of generating the extra band such as the opportunity to
   reduce the required amount of labeled data.}},

Title = {{Latency Estimation Tool and Investigation of Neural Networks Inference
   on Mobile GPU}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A lot of deep learning applications are desired to be run on mobile
   devices. Both accuracy and inference time are meaningful for a lot of
   them. While the number of FLOPs is usually used as a proxy for neural
   network latency, it may not be the best choice. In order to obtain a
   better approximation of latency, the research community uses lookup
   tables of all possible layers for the calculation of the inference on a
   mobile CPU. It requires only a small number of experiments.
   Unfortunately, on a mobile GPU, this method is not applicable in a
   straightforward way and shows low precision. In this work, we consider
   latency approximation on a mobile GPU as a data- and hardware-specific
   problem. Our main goal is to construct a convenient Latency Estimation
   Tool for Investigation (LETI) of neural network inference and building
   robust and accurate latency prediction models for each specific task. To
   achieve this goal, we make tools that provide a convenient way to
   conduct massive experiments on different target devices focusing on a
   mobile GPU. After evaluation of the dataset, one can train the
   regression model on experimental data and use it for future latency
   prediction and analysis. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability
   of such an approach on a subset of the popular NAS-Benchmark 101 dataset
   for two different mobile GPU.}},

Title = {{MixChannel: Advanced Augmentation for Multispectral Satellite Images}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Usage of multispectral satellite imaging data opens vast possibilities
   for monitoring and quantitatively assessing properties or objects of
   interest on a global scale. Machine learning and computer vision (CV)
   approaches show themselves as promising tools for automatizing satellite
   image analysis. However, there are limitations in using CV for satellite
   data. Mainly, the crucial one is the amount of data available for model
   training. This paper presents a novel image augmentation approach called
   MixChannel that helps to address this limitation and improve the
   accuracy of solving segmentation and classification tasks with
   multispectral satellite images. The core idea is to utilize the fact
   that there is usually more than one image for each location in remote
   sensing tasks, and this extra data can be mixed to achieve the more
   robust performance of the trained models. The proposed approach
   substitutes some channels of the original training image with channels
   from other images of the exact location to mix auxiliary data. This
   augmentation technique preserves the spatial features of the original
   image and adds natural color variability with some probability. We also
   show an efficient algorithm to tune channel substitution probabilities.
   We report that the MixChannel image augmentation method provides a
   noticeable increase in performance of all the considered models in the
   studied forest types classification problem.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of general non-linear stochastic optimal control with small

   modification of the TT-VI algorithm called TT-Q-Iteration (TT-QI) is
   proposed by authors. In it, the nonlinear Bellman Optimality Operator is
   iteratively applied to the solution as a composition of internal Tensor
   Train algebraic operations and TT-CROSS algorithm. We show that it has
   lower asymptotic complexity per iteration than the method existing in
   the literature, provided that TT-ranks of transition probabilities are
   small. In test examples of an underpowered inverted pendulum and Dubins
   cars our method shows up to 3-10 times faster convergence in terms of

Abstract = {{Modern algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are

Title = {{Optimization of Water Quality Monitoring Networks Using Metaheuristic
   Approaches: Moscow Region Use Case}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Currently many countries are struggling to rationalize water quality
   monitoring stations which is caused by economic demand. Though this
   process is essential indeed, the exact elements of the system to be
   optimized without a subsequent quality and accuracy loss still remain
   obscure. Therefore, accurate historical data on groundwater pollution is
   required to detect and monitor considerable environmental impacts. To
   collect such data appropriate sampling and assessment methodologies with
   an optimum spatial distribution augmented should be exploited. Thus, the
   configuration of water monitoring sampling points and the number of the
   points required are now considered as a fundamental optimization
   challenge. The paper offers and tests metaheuristic approaches for
   optimization of monitoring procedure and multi-factors assessment of
   water quality in ``New Moscow{''} area. It is shown that the considered
   algorithms allow us to reduce the size of the training sample set, so
   that the number of points for monitoring water quality in the area can
   be halved. Moreover, reducing the dataset size improved the quality of
   prediction by 20\%. The obtained results convincingly demonstrate that
   the proposed algorithms dramatically decrease the total cost of analysis
   without dampening the quality of monitoring and could be recommended for
   optimization purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dimensional representations, or embeddings, of a graph's nodes
   facilitate several practical data science and data engineering tasks. As
   such embeddings rely, explicitly or implicitly, on a similarity measure
   among nodes, they require the computation of a quadratic similarity
   matrix, inducing a tradeoff between space complexity and embedding
   quality. To date, no graph embedding work combines (i) linear space
   complexity, (ii) a nonlinear transform as its basis, and (iii)
   nontrivial quality guarantees. In this paper we introduce FREDE
   (FREquent Directions Embedding), a graph embedding based on matrix
   sketching that combines those three desiderata. Starting out from the
   observation that embedding methods aim to preserve the covariance among
   the rows of a similarity matrix, FREDE iteratively improves on quality
   while individually processing rows of a nonlinearly transformed PPR
   similarity matrix derived from a stateof-the-art graph embedding method
   and provides, at any iteration, column-covariance approximation
   guarantees in due course almost indistinguishable from those of the
   optimal approximation by SVD. Our experimental evaluation on variably
   sized networks shows that FREDE performs almost as well as SVD and
   competitively against state-of-the-art embedding methods in diverse data
   science tasks, even when it is based on as little as 10\% of node
   similarities.}},

Abstract = {{Big data analysis has become a crucial part of new emerging technologies
   such as the internet of things, cyber-physical analysis, deep learning,

   tools for handling big data tensors. They accelerate decomposing
   large-scale data tensors by reducing the computational complexity of
   deterministic algorithms and the communication among different levels of
   memory hierarchy, which is the main bottleneck in modern computing
   environments and architectures. In this article, we review recent
   advances in randomization for computation of Tucker decomposition and
   Higher Order SVD (HOSVD). We discuss random projection and sampling
   approaches, single-pass and multi-pass randomized algorithms and how to
   utilize them in the computation of the Tucker decomposition and the

Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Among different forest inventory problems, one of the most basic is
   defining dominant species. These data are crucial in forest management
   to determine forest category, and a cheaper remote sensing-based
   approach would be a useful supplement to field surveys. We used
   WorldView multispectral satellite imagery to address this problem as an
   image segmentation task dividing the image into regions with particular
   dominant species. Neural networks have recently become one of the most
   useful tools for this kind of problem, including incomplete or erroneous
   training labels. However, it is still challenging to distinguish between
   such similar patterns as different forest compositions. To handle this,
   we represented the multiclass forest classification problem as a
   hierarchical set of binary classification tasks, which allowed us to
   reach better results with both high- and medium-resolution satellite
   imagery. We also examined supplementary data, such as tree height, to
   improve the species classification results for wider tree age diversity.
   We conducted experiments considering six neural network architectures to
   find the best one for each task in the hierarchical decomposition. The
   proposed approach was tested on sample territories in Leningrad Oblast
   of Russia, for which the field-based observations were acquired and made
   publicly available as a single dataset. The proposed approach showed
   significantly better results (average F1-score 0.84) than multiclass
   classification (average F1-score 0.7).}},

Abstract = {{Recent work demonstrated the benefits of studying continuous-time
   dynamics governing the GAN training However, this dynamics is analyzed
   in the model parameter space, which results in finite-dimensional
   dynamical systems. We propose a novel perspective where we study the
   local dynamics of adversarial training in the general functional space
   and show how it can be represented as a system of partial differential
   equations. Thus, the convergence properties can be inferred from the
   eigenvalues of the resulting differential operator. We show that these
   eigenvalues can be efficiently estimated from the target dataset before
   training Our perspective reveals several insights on the practical
   tricks commonly used to stabilize GANs, such as gradient penalty, data
   augmentation, and advanced integration schemes. As an immediate
   practical benefit, we demonstrate how one can a priori select an optimal
   data augmentation strategy for a particular generation task.}},

Title = {{QTT-isogeometric solver in two dimensions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Elliptical PDEs are at the core of many computational problems.
   Sometimes it is necessary to solve them on fine meshes, which entail
   huge memory footprints and low computational speeds. We provide a method
   to solve elliptical PDEs on fine grids with lowered memory consumption
   and improved convergence.
   This paper considers one typical elliptical PDE - the Poisson equation
   on various polygonal domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The
   Finite Element Method (FEM) is used for numerical solution. FEM
   approximates a two-dimensional PDE as a system of linear equations Au =
   f. For an n-by-n mesh grid the sparse representation of A has the size
   of O (n(2)). We replace the sparse matrix representation with a
   Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) representation to obtain O ((logn)(alpha))
   time and memory complexity to construct both A and f . This is ensured
   by constant-bounded QTT approximation ranks. AMEn solver is used on the
   final linear system, and its iterations are faster for low rank QTT
   approximation. To avoid rank growth caused by the intrinsic structure of
   A we introduce a new operation z-kron which constructs a matrix with
   rows and columns permuted into so called z-order. An algorithm to
   construct A in z-order directly in QTT with O (1) ranks w.r.t. n is
   provided. The proposed method is used to solve the Poisson equation on
   two different polygonal domains. Experiments show that our approach
   significantly improves memory consumption and speed over classical
   sparse-matrix based partial differential equation solvers like FEniCS.

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art deep classifiers are intriguingly vulnerable to
   universal adversarial perturbations: single disturbances of small
   magnitude that lead to misclassification of most inputs. This phenomena
   may potentially result in a serious security problem. Despite the
   extensive research in this area, there is a lack of theoretical
   understanding of the structure of these perturbations. In image domain,
   there is a certain visual similarity between patterns, that represent
   these perturbations, and classical Turing patterns, which appear as a
   solution of non-linear partial differential equations and are underlying
   concept of many processes in nature. In this paper, we provide a
   theoretical bridge between these two different theories, by mapping a
   simplified algorithm for crafting universal perturbations to
   (inhomogeneous) cellular automata, the latter is known to generate
   Turing patterns. Furthermore, we propose to use Turing patterns,
   generated by cellular automata, as universal perturbations, and
   experimentally show that they significantly degrade the performance of
   deep learning models. We found this method to be a fast and efficient
   way to create a data-agnostic quasi-imperceptible perturbation in the
   black-box scenario. The source code is available at

Abstract = {{Tensor networks are the main building blocks in various computational
   sciences, ranging from many-body theory and quantum computing to
   probability and machine learning. Here we propose a parallel algorithm
   for the contraction of tensor networks using probabilistic graphical
   models. Given a tensor network, this algorithm splits the contraction
   task almost optimally into subtasks, which can be contracted
   independently in parallel. Our approach is based on the heuristic
   solution of the mu-treewidth deletion problem in graph theory. We apply
   the resulting algorithm to the simulation of random quantum circuits and
   discuss the extensions for general tensor network contractions.
   According to our estimates, the lower bound on the simulation time of 1
   million amplitudes of a 49-qubit circuit of depth 40 on the Summit
   supercomputer is >5 seconds.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the matrices approximated in H-2 format. The
   direct solution, as well as the preconditioning of systems with such

   factorization of the H-2 matrix that allows to substitute direct H-2
   solution with the solution of the system with an equivalent sparse

   parameters of the H-2 matrix. In the numerical experiments, we show the

Abstract = {{The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is a convenient and intuitive
   tool for tensor factorization; however, for higher order tensors, it
   often exhibits high computational cost and permutation of tensor
   entries, and these undesirable effects grow exponentially with the
   tensor order. Prior compression of tensor in-hand can reduce the
   computational cost of CPD, but this is only applicable when the rank R
   of the decomposition does not exceed the tensor dimensions. To resolve
   these issues, we present a novel method for CPD of higher order tensors,
   which rests upon a simple tensor network of representative
   interconnected core tensors of orders not higher than 3. For rigor, we
   develop an exact conversion scheme from the core tensors to the factor
   matrices in CPD and an iterative algorithm of low complexity to estimate
   these factor matrices for the inexact case. Comprehensive simulations
   over a variety of scenarios support the proposed approach.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimality of the restriction and prolongation
   operators in the geometric multigrid method (GMG). GMG is used in
   solving discretized partial differential equation (PDE) and it relies
   greatly on the restriction and prolongation operators. Many methods to
   find these operators were proposed, but most of them have limited
   optimality proofs. To study their optimality we introduce stochastic
   convergence functional, which estimates the spectral radius of the
   iteration matrix for given GMG parameters. We implement the GMG method
   in a modern machine learning framework that can automatically compute
   the gradients of the introduced convergence functional with respect to
   restriction and prolongation operators. Therefore, we can minimize the
   proposed functional starting from some initial parameters and get better
   ones after some iterations of stochastic gradient descent. To illustrate
   the performance of the proposed approach, we carry out experiments on
   the discretized Poisson equation, Helmholtz equation and singularly
   perturbed convection-diffusion equation and demonstrate that proposed
   approach gives operators, which lead to faster convergence. (C) 2019

Title = {{Active Subspace of Neural Networks: Structural Analysis and Universal
   Attacks}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON MATHEMATICS OF DATA SCIENCE}},

Pages = {{1096-1122}},
Abstract = {{Active subspace is a model reduction method widely used in the
   uncertainty quantification community. In this paper, we propose
   analyzing the internal structure and vulnerability of deep neural
   networks using active subspace. Firstly, we employ the active subspace
   to measure the number of ``active neurons{''}{''} at each intermediate
   layer, which indicates that the number of neurons can be reduced from
   several thousands to several dozens. This motivates us to change the
   network structure and to develop a new and more compact network,
   referred to as ASNet, that has significantly fewer model parameters.
   Secondly, we propose analyzing the vulnerability of a neural network
   using active subspace by finding an additive universal adversarial
   attack vector that can misclassify a dataset with a high probability.
   Our experiments on CIFAR-10 show that ASNet can achieve 23.98x parameter
   and 7.30x flops reduction. The universal active subspace attack vector
   can achieve around 20\% higher attack ratio compared with the existing
   approaches in our numerical experiments. The PyTorch codes for this
   paper are available online.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the tensor completion problem representing
   the solution in the tensor train (TT) format. It is assumed that the
   tensor is of high order, and tensor values are generated by an unknown
   smooth function. The assumption allows us to develop an efficient
   initialization scheme based on Gaussian process regression and the
   TT-cross approximation technique. The proposed approach can be used in
   conjunction with any optimization algorithm that is usually utilized in
   tensor completion problems. We empirically justify that in this case the
   reconstruction error improves compared to the tensor completion with
   random initialization. As an additional benefit, our technique
   automatically selects rank thanks to using the TT-cross approximation

Abstract = {{We present a novel technique for assessing the dynamics of multiphase
   fluid flow in the oil reservoir. We demonstrate an efficient workflow
   for handling the 3D reservoir simulation data in a way which is orders
   of magnitude faster than the conventional routine. The workflow (we call
   it ``Metamodel{''}) is based on a projection of the system dynamics into
   a latent variable space, using Variational Autoencoder model, where
   Recurrent Neural Network predicts the dynamics. We show that being
   trained on multiple results of the conventional reservoir modelling, the
   Metamodel does not compromise the accuracy of the reservoir dynamics
   reconstruction in a significant way. It allows forecasting not only the
   flow rates from the wells, but also the dynamics of pressure and fluid
   saturations within the reservoir. The results open a new perspective in
   the optimization of oilfield development as the scenario screening could
   be accelerated sufficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Such problems as computation of spectra of spin chains and vibrational
   spectra of molecules can be written as high-dimensional eigenvalue
   problems, i.e., when the eigenvector can be naturally represented as a

   problems, however, their performance deteriorates quickly when the
   number of eigenstates to be computed increases. We address this issue by
   designing a new algorithm motivated by the ideas of Riemannian
   optimization (optimization on smooth manifolds) for the approximation of
   multiple eigenstates in the tensor-train format, which is also known as
   matrix product state representation. The proposed algorithm is

Abstract = {{Purpose The full understanding of the effect of mineral waste-based
   fertilizer in soil is still unrelieved, because of the extreme complex
   chemical composition and plethora of their action pathways. The purposes
   of this paper is to quantify the input of PG into the soil ecosystem
   process, considering the direct effects of PG as a whole on soil
   environment using of a plethora of chemical, toxicological, and
   biological tests.
   Materials and methods Greenhouse experiment includes different PG doses
   (0, 1\%, 3\%, 7.5\%, 15\%, 25\%, and 40\%) and two-time collection
   points after treatments-7 and 28 days. For each treatment and each time
   collection point, we measure (i) soil pH, bioavailable (H(2)0 and
   NH4COOH-extractable) element content (S, P, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Sr,
   Ba, F); (ii) soil enzyme activities-dehydrogenase, urease, acid
   phosphatase, FDA; (iii) soil CO2 respiration activity with and without
   glucose addition; (iv) Eisenia fetida, Sinapis alba, and Avena sativa
   responses. Finally, we combine the ordinary chemical, toxicology, and
   biological measuring of soil properties with state-of-the-art
   mathematical analysis, namely (i) support vector machines (used for
   prediction), (ii) mutual information test (variable importance tasks),
   (iii) t-SNE and LLE algorithms (used for unsupervised classification).
   Results and discussion The results show similarity between the 0\%, 1\%,
   and 3\% PG treatments in all collection times based on the toxicological
   and biological properties. Beyond 7.5\% PG, some biological test was
   significantly inhibited in response to trace element stress. Among all
   tested parameters, soil urease activities, soil respiration activities
   after glucose addition, S. alba root lengths, and E. fetida survival
   rates show sensitivity to PG addition. Furthermore, the machine learning
   algorithms revealed that only several elements (mobile and water-soluble
   forms of Ca, Ba, Sr, S, and Na; water-soluble F) could be responsible to
   elevated soil toxicity for those indicators. SVR models were able to
   predict soil biological and ecotoxicity properties, and increasing
   numbers of randomly selected training examples from 50 to 90\% of
   initial experimental data significantly improved model performance.
   Conclusions At this study, we demonstrate benefits of unsupervised
   machine learning methods for investigating toxicity of man-made
   substances in soil that can be further applied to risk assessments of
   various toxins, which are of significant interest to environmental
   protection.}},

Title = {{Bayesian optimization for seed germination}},
Journal = {{PLANT METHODS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundEfficient seed germination is a crucial task at the beginning
   of crop cultivation. Although boundaries of environmental parameters
   that should be maintained are well studied, fine-tuning can
   significantly improve the efficiency, which is infeasible to be done
   manually due to the high dimensionality of the parameter
   space.ResultsTraditionally seed germination is performed in climatic
   chambers with controlled environmental conditions. In this study, we
   perform a set of multiple-day seed germination experiments in the
   controllable environment. We use up to three climatic chambers to adjust
   humidity, temperature, water supply and apply machine learning algorithm
   called Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the parameters that improve
   seed germination. Experimental results show that our approach allows to
   increase the germination efficiency for different types of seeds
   compared to the initial expert knowledge-based guess.ConclusionOur
   experiments demonstrated that BO could help to identify the values of
   the controllable parameters that increase seed germination efficiency.
   The proposed methodology is model-free, and we argue that it may be
   useful for a variety of optimization problems in precision agriculture.
   Further experimental studies are required to investigate the
   effectiveness of our approach for different seed cultures and controlled
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Topological optimization finds a material density distribution
   minimizing a functional of the solution of a partial differential
   equation (PDE), subject to a set of constraints (typically, a bound on
   the volume or mass of the material).
   Using a finite elements discretization (FEM) of the PDE and functional
   we obtain an integer programming problem. Due to approximation error of
   the FEM discretization, optimization problem becomes mesh-depended and
   possess false, physically inadequate optimums, while functional value
   heavily depends on the fineness of discretization scheme used to compute
   it. To alleviate this problem, we propose regularization of given
   functional by error estimate of the FEM discretization. This
   regularization provides robustness of solutions and improves obtained
   functional values as well.
   While the idea is broadly applicable, in this paper we apply our method
   to the heat conduction optimization. Problems of this type are of
   practical importance in design of heat conduction channels, heat sinks
   and other types of heat guides.}},

   hyper-parameter tuning and a quick folding-in computation for generating
   recommendations instantly even in highly dynamic online environments.
   The algorithm utilizes a generalized formulation of the singular value
   decomposition, which adds flexibility to the solution and allows
   imposing the desired structure on its latent space. Conveniently, the
   resulting model also admits an efficient and straightforward solution
   for the cold start scenario. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set

Abstract = {{We propose a new algorithm for spectral learning of Hidden Markov Models

   represented in the tensor train (TT) format. Using TT-format, we get an
   approximation by minimizing the Frobenius distance between the empirical
   joint probability distribution and tensors with low TT-ranks with core
   tensors normalization constraints. We propose an algorithm for the
   solution of the optimization problem that is based on the alternating
   least squares (ALS) approach and develop its fast version for sparse
   tensors. The order of the tensor d is a parameter of our algorithm. We
   have compared the performance of our algorithm with the existing

Abstract = {{We propose a novel framework PROVEN to PRObabilistically VErify Neural
   network's robustness with statistical guarantees. PROVEN provides
   probability certificates of neural network robustness when the input
   perturbation follow distributional characterization. Notably, PROVEN is
   derived from current state-of-the-art worst-case neural network
   robustness verification frameworks, and therefore it can provide
   probability certificates with little computational overhead on top of
   existing methods such as FastLin, CROWN and CNN-Cert. Experiments on
   small and large MNIST and CIFAR neural network models demonstrate our
   probabilistic approach can tighten up robustness certificate to around
   1.8 x and 3.5x with at least a 99.99\% confidence compared with the
   worst-case robustness certificate by CROWN and CNN-Cert.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling interactions between features improves the performance of
   machine learning solutions in many domains (e.g. recommender systems or
   sentiment analysis). In this paper, we introduce Exponential machines
   (ExM), a predictor that models all interactions of every order. The key
   idea is to represent an exponentially large tensor of parameters in a
   factorized format called tensor train (n). The tensor train format
   regularizes the model and lets you control the number of underlying
   parameters. To train the model, we develop a stochastic Riemannian
   optimization procedure, which allows us to fit tensors with approximate
   to 2(56) entries. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art
   performance on synthetic data with high-order interactions and that it
   works on par with high-order factorization machines on a recommender
   system dataset MovieLens 100 K.}},

Abstract = {{A dataset of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of
   medicinal plant extracts from 74 species was generated and used for
   training and validating plant species identification algorithms. Various
   strategies for data handling and feature space extraction were tested.
   Constrained Tucker decomposition, large-scale (more than 1500 variables)
   discrete Bayesian Networks and autoencoder based dimensionality
   reduction coupled with continuous Bayes classifier and logistic
   regression were optimized to achieve the best accuracy. Even with
   elimination of all retention time values accuracies of up to 96\% and
   92\% were achieved on validation set for plant species and plant organ
   identification respectively. Benefits and drawbacks of used algortihms
   were discussed. Preliminary test showed that developed approaches
   exhibit tolerance to changes in data created by using different
   extraction methods and/or equipment. Dataset with more than 2200
   chromatograms was published in an open repository.}},

   convergence rate of standard fixed-point iteration without rank

Abstract = {{We present an investigation of the thermal dissociation of the gas
   phase, non-covalent streptavidin tetramer ion. Using an extended
   desolvating capillary, it was observed that this complex fragments at an
   activation energy around 75 kJ/mole. The fragmentation occurs via charge
   migration and the ejection of a single monomer that carries half the
   total charge. Temperature increases result in intensive
   supermetallization by sodium ions and, eventually, in thermal
   dissociation. Using the in-ESI source H/D exchange approach, we observed
   that deuterium scrambling during the dissociation is relatively low. To
   better understand the charged droplets dynamics, we performed accurate
   computer simulations of airflow inside the desolvating capillary,
   including calculating the gas velocity, temperature and pressure
   distributions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks has
   been attracting a lot of attention in recent studies. It has been shown
   that for many state of the art DNNs performing image classification
   there exist universal adversarial perturbations image-agnostic
   perturbations mere addition of which to natural images with high
   probability leads to their misclassification. In this work we propose a
   new algorithm for constructing such universal perturbations. Our
   approach is based on computing the so-called (p,q)-singular vectors of
   the Jacobian matrices of hidden layers of a network. Resulting
   perturbations present interesting visual patterns, and by using only 64
   images we were able to construct universal perturbations with more than
   60 \% fooling rate on the dataset consisting of 50000 images. We also
   investigate a correlation between the maximal singular value of the
   Jacobian matrix and the fooling rate of the corresponding singular
   vector, and show that the constructed perturbations generalize across
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{In the light of the increasing demand for food production, climate
   change challenges, and economic pressure, precision farming is becoming
   an ever-growing market. Nowadays using satellite images for field zoning
   has become a widely spread technique employed in precision agriculture.
   Usually satellite images are used to evaluate Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a common yield assessment. At the same time
   it is rather a challenging task to designing NDVI maps as compared to
   ordinary RGB images. We propose a new algorithm for site-specific zoning
   based on the performance of a well-known and widely used ICA algorithm
   (FastICA). We analyse high resolution RGB satellite images for 3 arable
   fields located in Kursk region, Russia, (2017) provided by the Planet
   Labs service. The main outcomes from this study are ( i) the algorithm
   creates site-specific zoning maps with a relative accuracy of yield
   distribution maps between 0.78 and 0.89; (ii) the algorithm requires a
   relatively small dataset - from 8 to 10 RGB images. The obtained results
   indicate that the algorithm in question can be used not only to identify
   management zones but also to map the variations in yield within the
   fields.}},

   insightful reformulations of some known convergence conditions that
   focus on the interplay between the contractivity of classical
   multiplicative Schwarz methods with overlapping subspaces and the
   curvature of low-rank matrix and tensor manifolds. While the
   verification of the abstract conditions in concrete scenarios remains
   open in most cases, we are able to provide an alternative and
   conceptually simple derivation of the asymptotic convergence rate of the
   two-sided block power method of numerical algebra for computing the
   dominant singular subspaces of a rectangular matrix. This method is
   equivalent to an alternating least squares method applied to a distance

Abstract = {{Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is a widely used method for performing
   scan-matching and registration. Being simple and robust, this method is
   still computationally expensive and may be challenging to use in
   real-time applications with limited resources on mobile platforms. In
   this paper we propose a novel effective method for acceleration of ICP
   which does not require substantial modifications to the existing code.
   This method is based on an idea of Anderson acceleration which is an
   iterative procedure for finding a fixed point of contractive mapping.
   The latter is often faster than a standard Picard iteration, usually
   used in ICP implementations. We show that ICP, being a fixed point
   problem, can be significantly accelerated by this method enhanced by
   heuristics to improve overall robustness. We implement proposed approach
   into Point Cloud Library (PCL) and make it available online.
   Benchmarking on the real-world data fully supports our claims.}},

Title = {{Natural Erosion of Sandstone as Shape Optimisation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Natural arches, pillars and other exotic sandstone formations have
   always been attracting attention for their unusual shapes and amazing
   mechanical balance that leave a strong impression of intelligent design
   rather than the result of a stochastic process. It has been recently
   demonstrated that these shapes could have been the result of the
   negative feedback between stress and erosion that originates in
   fundamental laws of friction between the rock's constituent particles.
   Here we present a deeper analysis of this idea and bridge it with the
   approaches utilized in shape and topology optimisation. It appears that
   the processes of natural erosion, driven by stochastic surface forces
   and Mohr-Coulomb law of dry friction, can be viewed within the framework
   of local optimisation for minimum elastic strain energy. Our hypothesis
   is confirmed by numerical simulations of the erosion using the
   topological-shape optimisation model. Our work contributes to a better
   understanding of stochastic erosion and feasible landscape formations
   that could be found on Earth and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Tensor-compressed numerical solution of elliptic multiscale-diffusion
   and high frequency scattering problems is considered. For either problem
   class, solutions exhibit multiple length scales governed by the
   corresponding scale parameter: the scale of oscillations of the
   diffusion coefficient or smallest wavelength, respectively. As is
   well-known, this imposes a scale-resolution requirement on the number of
   degrees of freedom required to accurately represent the solutions in
   standard finite-element (FE) discretizations. Low-order FE methods are
   by now generally perceived unsuitable for high-frequency coefficients in
   diffusion problems and high wavenumbers in scattering problems.
   Accordingly, special techniques have been proposed instead (such as
   numerical homogenization, heterogeneous multiscale method, oversampling,
   etc.) which require, in some form, a-priori information on the
   microstructure of the solution. We analyze the approximation properties
   of tensor-formatted, conforming first-order FE methods for scale
   resolution in multiscale problems without a-priori information. The FE
   methods are based on the dynamic extraction of principal components from
   stiffness matrices, load and solution vectors by the quantized tensor
   train (QTT) decomposition. For prototypical model problems, we prove
   that this approach, by means of the QTT reparametrization of the FE
   space, allows to identify effective degrees of freedom to replace the
   degrees of freedom of a uniform ``virtual{''} (i.e. never directly
   accessed) mesh, whose number may be prohibitively large to realize
   computationally. Precisely, solutions of model elliptic homogenization
   and high-frequency acoustic scattering problems are proved to admit
   QTT-structured approximations whose number of effective degrees of
   freedom required to reach a prescribed approximation error scales
   polylogarithmically with respect to the reciprocal of the target
   Sobolev-norm accuracy epsilon with only a mild dependence on the scale
   parameter. No a-priori information on the nature of the problems and
   intrinsic length scales of the solution is required in the numerical
   realization of the presently proposed QTT-structured approach. Although
   only univariate model multiscale problems are analyzed in the present
   paper, QTT structured algorithms are applicable also in several
   variables. Detailed numerical experiments confirm the theoretical
   bounds. As a corollary of our analysis, we prove that for the mentioned
   model problems, the Kolmogorov n-widths of solution sets are
   exponentially small for analytic data, independently of the problems'
   scale parameters. That implies, in particular, the exponential
   convergence of reduced basis techniques which is scale-robust, i.e.,
   independent of the scale parameter in the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Wide variety of engineering design problems can be formulated as
   constrained optimization problems where the shape and topology of the
   domain are optimized to reduce costs while satisfying certain
   constraints. Several mathematical approaches were developed to address
   the problem of finding optimal design of an engineered structure. Recent
   works {[}10, 23] have demonstrated the feasibility of boundary element
   method as a tool for topological-shape optimization. However, it was
   noted that the approach has certain drawbacks, and in particular high
   computational cost of the iterative optimization process. In this short
   note we suggestways to address critical limitations of boundary element
   method as a tool for topological-shape optimization. We validate our
   approaches by supplementing the existing complex variables boundary
   element code for elastostatic problems with robust tools for the fast
   topological-shape optimization. The efficiency of the approach is
   illustrated with a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{SimRank is a well-known similarity measure between graph vertices. This
   measure relies on a graph topology and is built on the intuition that
   `two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects'.
   Formalization of this intuition leads to a system of linear equations,
   so large that even the solution vector will not fit in the RAM for many
   real-world graphs. To solve this issue we propose a new method based on
   a low-rank approximation of the linear system solution. This approach
   requires less memory and provides a significant calculation speed-up.
   The experiments show that the proposed method provides an accurate
   SimRank approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model, well known by
   its implementation in ``word2vec{''} software, is usually optimized by
   stochastic gradient descent. However, the optimization of SGNS objective
   can be viewed as a problem of searching for a good matrix with the
   low-rank constraint. The most standard way to solve this type of
   problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the
   SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using
   Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular
   competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over
   SPPMI matrix.}},
