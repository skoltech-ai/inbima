   041022-in which each interaction type is mapped to its own network
   layer; e.g. multi-layer transportation networks, coupled social
   networks, metabolic and regulatory networks, etc. A salient physical
   phenomena emerging from multiplexity is super-diffusion: exhibited by an
   accelerated diffusion admitted by the multi-layer structure as compared
   to any single layer. Theoretically super-diffusion was only known to be
   predicted using the spectral gap of the full Laplacian of a multiplex
   network and its interacting layers. Here we turn to machine learning
   (ML) which has developed techniques to recognize, classify, and
   characterize complex sets of data. We show that modern ML architectures,
   such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks (CNN), can
   classify and predict the presence of super-diffusion in multiplex
   networks with 94.12\% accuracy. Such predictions can be done in situ,
   without the need to determine spectral properties of a network.}},

Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Clinical examination of three-dimensional image data of compound
   anatomical objects, such as complex joints, remains a tedious process,
   demanding the time and the expertise of physicians. For instance,
   automation of the segmentation task of the TMJ (temporomandibular joint)
   has been hindered by its compound three-dimensional shape, multiple
   overlaid textures, an abundance of surrounding irregularities in the
   skull, and a virtually omnidirectional range of the jaw's motion-all of
   which extend the manual annotation process to more than an hour per
   patient. To address the challenge, we invent a new workflow for the 3D
   segmentation task: namely, we propose to segment empty spaces between
   all the tissues surrounding the object-the so-called negative volume
   segmentation. Our approach is an end-to-end pipeline that comprises a
   V-Net for bone segmentation, a 3D volume construction by inflation of
   the reconstructed bone head in all directions along the normal vector to
   its mesh faces. Eventually confined within the skull bones, the inflated
   surface occupies the entire ``negative{''} space in the joint,
   effectively providing a geometrical/topological metric of the joint's
   health. We validate the idea on the CT scans in a 50-patient dataset,
   annotated by experts in maxillofacial medicine, quantitatively compare
   the asymmetry given the left and the right negative volumes, and
   automate the entire framework for clinical adoption.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's Disease (PD) is currently the fastest growing
   neurodegenerative disease. It decreases the quality of life for
   patients, especially when not diagnosed properly and timely. Accurate
   diagnostic of PD is complicated by the fact that there exist several
   neurodegenerative diseases with similar motor symptoms, e.g. essential
   tremor. In this work, we report on a second opinion system based on the
   video analysis and classification of subjects using machine learning
   methods including feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and
   classification. Our approach serves for avoiding a typical misdiagnosis
   of PD by essential tremor. Consequently, we designed 15 common tasks and
   recorded the movement video. Video data was collected from 89 subjects
   at a medical center and labeled by doctors. We first demonstrate
   classification between the healthy subjects and subjects with PD
   suspected case followed by the classification between the subjects with
   true PD and the subjects with essential tremor. We achieved f1 score
   0.90 for the first classification and f1 score 0.84 for the second
   classification. The proposed unobtrusive approach demonstrated its
   feasibility through a pilot study. It opens up wide vista for
   differentiating PD patients against other patients and not against a
   cohort of healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with
   the extrapyramidal motor system disorder currently being the second most
   common neurodegenerative disorder. The first clinical symptoms can
   manifest themselves long before the retirement age and inevitably lead
   to reducing the possibility of continuing work. However, PD is sometimes
   misdiagnosed. In this article, we discuss the typical misdiagnosed cases
   and propose a second opinion system based on wearable sensors and
   artificial intelligence. For this reason, we designed a number of common
   tasks and recorded the movement data using wearable sensors worn by
   individuals with PD and other extrapyramidal disorders. PD patients are
   differentiated against other patients with similar diseases and not
   against healthy subjects. This allows one to measure the true
   specificity of wearable technologies with regard to detecting PD. Data
   analysis and classification of the types of tremor using machine
   learning methods (feature extraction, dimensionality reduction,
   classification) helps significantly improve the accuracy of PD
   diagnosis. Our results show that, when considering bradykinesia and
   tremor together, the accuracy of distinguishing PD from similar diseases
   increases (f1 score 0.88). This closed-loop configuration makes it
   possible to tune exercises to maximize the diagnostic value of the
   entire routine. We report approbation on 56 patients.}},

Title = {{Defining Optimal Exercises for Efficient Detection of Parkinson's
   Disease Using Machine Learning and Wearable Sensors}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{70}},
Abstract = {{Our society exhibits a worldwide trait of a quickly growing cohort of
   patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease
   (PD). According to the analysts, there is a plausible ``PD pandemic{''}
   to occur within the next two decades. Nowadays, the research in the area
   focuses on how to detect, predict, or classify PD and similar diseases
   without addressing the point of what activities or exercises a subject
   should do to improve the performance of these tasks. In this article, we
   propose a method based on machine learning (ML) and wearable sensors to
   identify the optimal exercises for the efficient detection of PD in
   patients. We first define 15 common tasks that are typically used to
   diagnose PD in modern clinical practice. However, these exercises still
   carry a high risk of misdiagnosis and, moreover, not all of them work
   well in the scope of existing ML solutions to support the diagnosis.
   Herein, we collect the data in a real clinical setting using a compact
   wearable wireless sensor node entailing a hoard gyroscope,
   accelerometer, and magnetometer. Application of ML methods to the
   collected data reveals three ``most efficient{''} exercises to assist
   diagnosticians with the highest discriminating power (0.9 ROC AUC in
   each task). The proposed solution can be implemented as a medical
   decision support system for real-time PD diagnostics.}},

   Driver Detection by Multi-Electrode Mapping}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be maintained by localized intramural
   reentrant drivers. However, AF driver detection by clinical surface-only
   multielectrode mapping (MEM) has relied on subjective interpretation of
   activation maps. We hypothesized that application of machine learning to
   electrogram frequency spectra may accurately automate driver detection
   by MEM and add some objectivity to the interpretation of MEM findings.
   Methods:
   Temporally and spatially stable single AF drivers were mapped
   simultaneously in explanted human atria (n=11) by subsurface
   near-infrared optical mapping (NIOM; 0.3 mm(2) resolution) and
   64-electrode MEM (higher density or lower density with 3 and 9 mm(2)
   resolution, respectively). Unipolar MEM and NIOM recordings were
   processed by Fourier transform analysis into 28 407 total Fourier
   spectra. Thirty-five features for machine learning were extracted from
   each Fourier spectrum.
   Results:
   Targeted driver ablation and NIOM activation maps efficiently defined
   the center and periphery of AF driver preferential tracks and provided
   validated annotations for driver versus nondriver electrodes in MEM
   arrays. Compared with analysis of single electrogram frequency features,
   averaging the features from each of the 8 neighboring electrodes,
   significantly improved classification of AF driver electrograms. The
   classification metrics increased when less strict annotation, including
   driver periphery electrodes, were added to driver center annotation.
   Notably, f1-score for the binary classification of higher-density
   catheter data set was significantly higher than that of lower-density
   catheter (0.81 +/- 0.02 versus 0.66 +/- 0.04, P0.05). The trained
   algorithm correctly highlighted 86\% of driver regions with higher
   density but only 80\% with lower-density MEM arrays (81\% for
   lower-density+higher-density arrays together).
   Conclusions:
   The machine learning model pretrained on Fourier spectrum features
   allows efficient classification of electrograms recordings as AF driver
   or nondriver compared with the NIOM gold-standard. Future application of
   NIOM-validated machine learning approach may improve the accuracy of AF
   driver detection for targeted ablation treatment in patients.}},

   synchrony control based on proximal policy optimization and two
   artificial neural networks in an Actor-Critic configuration. A class of
   physically meaningful reward functions enabling the suppression of

Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT) simulators are versatile tools for scanning
   protocol evaluation, optimization of geometrical design parameters,
   assessment of image reconstruction algorithms, and evaluation of the
   impact of future innovations attempting to improve the performance of CT
   scanners. Computational human phantoms (CHPs) play a key role in
   simulators for the radiation dosimetry and assessment of image quality
   tasks in the medical x-ray systems. Since the construction of
   patient-specific CHPs can be both difficult and time-consuming, nominal
   standard/reference CHPs have been established, yielding significant
   discrepancies in the special design and optimization demands of patient
   dose and imaging protocols for most medical applications. Therefore, the
   aim of this work was to develop a personalized Monte-Carlo (MC) CT
   simulator equipped with a fast and well-structured tool-kit called
   DeepSegNet for automatic generation of patient-specific CHPs based on
   MRI images, working under two principal algorithms. To this end, we
   first developed a 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) for the
   automated segmentation of 3D MRI images to detect anatomical
   organs/tissues. Then, a 3D voxel merging (3DVM) algorithm constructing
   CHPs and making fast MC calculations were developed. The proposed 3DCNN
   benefits from the main merit of residual networks by designing a
   15-layer model. Next, the 3DVM algorithm utilizes the segmented data
   acquired from the former step, to create realistic and optimized CHPs by
   material mapping and voxel size manipulating. The performance of our
   3DCNN model on 20 patients as test cases was 84.54\% and 74.52 \% in
   terms of average accuracy and Dice-Coefficient, respectively,
   outperforming SegNet, as a comparable method by 2\%. Finally, we
   developed an MC CT simulator by implementing a set of our generated
   CHPs. The efficiency of our 3DVM algorithm in constructing CHPs was
   assessed in terms of MC execution time and the number of merged voxels
   representing occupied storage memory and compared to the existing
   lattice method. Besides, the accuracy of our 3DVM investigated through
   the estimation of patient dose maps and image reconstruction. Results
   demonstrated a significant reduction of about 96 \% in the number of
   voxels and a 15\% reduction in MC execution time for x-ray photon
   transportation while keeping the same accuracy. Therefore, this software
   package has a strong potential in the optimization of therapeutic and
   radiological imaging procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral Difficult Venous Access (PDVA) is a commonplace problem in
   clinical practice which results in repetitive punctures, damaged veins,
   and significant discomfort to the patients. Nowadays, the poor
   visibility of subcutaneous vasculature in the visible part of the light
   spectrum is overcome by near-infrared (NIR) imaging and a returned
   projection of the recognized vasculature back to the arm of the patient.
   We introduce the first ``smart{''} engine to govern the components of
   such imagers in a mixed reality setting. Namely, a closed-loop hardware
   system that optimizes cross-talk between the virtual mask generated from
   the NIR measurement and the projected augmenting image is proposed. Such
   real-virtual image translation is accomplished in several steps. First,
   the NIR vein segmentation task is solved using U-Net-based network
   architecture and the Frangi vesselness filter. The generated mask is
   then transformed and translated into the visible domain by a projector
   that adjusts for distortions and misalignment with the true vasculature
   using the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We propose a new
   class of mixed reality reward functions that guarantees proper alignment
   of the projected image regardless of angle, translation, and scale
   offsets between the NIR measurement and the visible projection.}},

Abstract = {{Approaches to constructing statistical phantoms (SPs) for the needs of
   data fusion with the real data have attracted a lot of attention in the
   recent years. SPs assist with radiation dosimetry and provide metrics
   for estimating image quality in the medical X-ray systems. Unlike
   existing SPs, we propose to consider both material electron densities
   and anatomical size variations models to portray realistic variations in
   radiologic data. We introduce a new adaptive unsupervised fusion
   approach for data augmentation, capable of generating a variety of
   medically adequate images. The model is based on a combination of
   continuous Poisson modelling of voxel values, Monte Carlo rejection
   sampling scheme, and a landmark-based warping. Unlike mere average of HU
   values of each organ (typical in the other state-of-art SPs), our
   augmented voxels depict intensity fluctuations, effectively mimicking a
   distribution of electron densities within each organ. In the
   experimental section, we evaluate the proposed method and demonstrate
   its superiority compared to the existing methods. This phantom
   generation could be instrumental for assessing dose uncertainty,
   unsupervised refinement of image reconstruction, image classification,
   and semantic segmentation tasks carried out by machine learning
   algorithms in the scenarios of limited available data.}},

Abstract = {{The success of neural networks is typically attributed to their ability
   to closely mimic relationships between features and labels observed in
   the training dataset. This, however, is only part of the answer: in
   addition to being fit to data, neural networks have been shown to be
   useful priors on the conditional distribution of labels given features
   and can be used as such even in the absence of trustworthy training
   labels. This feature of neural networks can be harnessed to train high
   quality models on low quality training data in tasks for which large
   high-quality ground truth datasets don't exist. One of these problems is
   assertion classification in biomedical texts: discriminating between
   positive, negative and speculative statements about certain pathologies
   a patient may have. We present an assertion classification methodology
   based on recurrent neural networks, attention mechanism and two flavours
   of transfer learning (language modelling and heuristic annotation) that
   achieves state of the art results on MIMIC-CXR radiology reports.}},

Abstract = {{Active learning is a technique that helps to minimize the annotation
   budget required for the creation of a labeled dataset while maximizing
   the performance of a model trained on this dataset. It has been shown
   that active learning can be successfully applied to sequence tagging
   tasks of text processing in conjunction with deep learning models even
   when a limited amount of labeled data is available. Recent advances in
   transfer learning methods for natural language processing based on deep
   pre-trained models such as ELMo and BERT offer a much better ability to
   generalize on small annotated datasets compared to their shallow
   counterparts. The combination of deep pre-trained models and active
   learning leads to a powerful approach to dealing with annotation
   scarcity. In this work, we investigate the potential of this approach on
   clinical and biomedical data. The experimental evaluation shows that the
   combination of active learning and deep pre-trained models outperforms
   the standard methods of active learning. We also suggest a modification
   to a standard uncertainty sampling strategy and empirically show that it
   could be beneficial for annotation of very skewed datasets. Finally, we
   propose an annotation tool empowered with active learning and deep
   pre-trained models that could be used for entity annotation directly
   from Jupyter IDE.}},

Abstract = {{We report an automated method for characterization of microvessel
   morphology in micrographs of brain tissue sections to enable the facile,
   quantitative analysis of vascular differences across large datasets
   consisting of hundreds of images with thousands of blood vessel objects.
   Our objective is to show that virtual 3D parametric models of
   vasculature are adequately capable of representing the morphology of
   naturally acquired data in neuropathology. In this work, we focus on
   three distinct morphologies that are most frequently observed in
   formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human brain tissue samples:
   single blood vessels showing no (or collapsed) significant lumen
   ({''}RoundLumen-{''}); single blood vessels with distinct lumen
   ({''}RoundLumen+{''}); two blood vessels bundled together in close
   proximity ({''}Twins{''}). The analysis involves extraction of features
   using pre-trained convolutional neural networks. A hierarchical
   classification is performed to distinguish single blood vessels
   (RoundLumen) from Twins; followed by a more granular classification
   between RoundLumen- and RoundLumen+. A side-by-side comparison of the
   virtual and natural data models is presented. We observed that
   classification models built on the virtual data perform well achieving
   accuracies of 92.8\% and 98.3\% for the two aforementioned
   classification tasks respectively.}},
