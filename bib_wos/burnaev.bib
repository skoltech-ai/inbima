Abstract = {{In this paper we extend the setting of the online prediction with expert
   advice to function-valued fore-casts. At each step of the online game
   several experts predict a function, and the learner has to efficiently
   aggregate these functional forecasts into a single forecast. We adapt
   basic mixable (and exponentially concave) loss functions to compare
   functional predictions and prove that these adaptations are also
   mix-able (exp-concave). We call this phenomenon mixability
   (exp-concavity) of integral loss functions. As an application of our
   main result, we prove that various loss functions used for probabilistic
   forecasting are mixable (exp-concave). The considered losses include
   Sliced Continuous Ranked Probability Score, Energy-Based Distance,
   Optimal Transport Costs \& Sliced Wasserstein-2 distance, Beta-2 \&
   Kullback-Leibler diver-gences, Characteristic function and Maximum Mean
   Discrepancies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization: A survey}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many traditional algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization
   problems involve using hand-crafted heuristics that sequentially
   construct a solution. Such heuristics are designed by domain experts and
   may often be suboptimal due to the hard nature of the problems.
   Reinforcement learning (RL) proposes a good alternative to automate the
   search of these heuristics by training an agent in a supervised or
   self-supervised manner. In this survey, we explore the recent
   advancements of applying RL frameworks to hard combinatorial problems.
   Our survey provides the necessary background for operations research and
   machine learning communities and showcases the works that are moving the
   field forward. We juxtapose recently proposed RL methods, laying out the
   timeline of the improvements for each problem, as well as we make a
   comparison with traditional algorithms, indicating that RL models can
   become a promising direction for solving combinatorial problems.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive Modeling problems deal with high-dimensional data; however,
   the curse of dimensionality presents an obstacle to the use of many
   methods for their solutions. In many applications, real-world data
   occupy only a very small part of high-dimensional observation space
   whose intrinsic dimension is essentially lower than that of the space. A
   popular model for such data is the manifold model, according to which
   the data lie on an unknown low-dimensional manifold (Data Manifold)
   embedded in the ambient high-dimensional space. Predictive modeling
   problems, which are studied under this assumption, are called manifold
   estimation problems. The general goal of such problems is to identify
   the low-dimensional structure of multidimensional data from a given
   dataset. If dataset points are sampled according to an unknown
   probability measure on the data manifold, there is a need to model
   manifolds when solving various machine learning problems. We provide a
   short survey of such problems and outline some approaches to their
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning and computer vision methods are showing good
   performance in medical imagery analysis. Yet only a few applications are
   now in clinical use and one of the reasons for that is poor
   transferability of the models to data from different sources or
   acquisition domains. Development of new methods and algorithms for the
   transfer of training and adaptation of the domain in multi-modal medical
   imaging data is crucial for the development of accurate models and their
   use in clinics. In present work, we overview methods used to tackle the
   domain shift problem in machine learning and computer vision. The
   algorithms discussed in this survey include advanced data processing,
   model architecture enhancing and featured training, as well as
   predicting in domain invariant latent space. The application of the
   autoencoding neural networks and their domain-invariant variations are
   heavily discussed in a survey. We observe the latest methods applied to
   the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data analysis and conclude on their
   performance as well as propose directions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{DensePose estimation task is a significant step forward for enhancing
   user experience computer vision applications ranging from augmented
   reality to cloth fitting. Existing neural network models capable of
   solving this task are heavily parameterized and a long way from being
   transferred to an embedded or mobile device. To enable Dense Pose
   inference on the end device with current models, one needs to support an
   expensive server-side infrastructure and have a stable internet
   connection. To make things worse, mobile and embedded devices do not
   always have a powerful GPU inside. In this work, we target the problem
   of redesigning the DensePose R-CNN model's architecture so that the
   final network retains most of its accuracy but becomes more light-weight
   and fast. To achieve that, we tested and incorporated many deep learning
   innovations from recent years, specifically performing an ablation study
   on 23 efficient backbone architectures, multiple two-stage detection
   pipeline modifications, and custom model quantization methods. As a
   result, we achieved 17x model size reduction and 2x latency improvement
   compared to the baseline model.(1)}},

   video frames given some past frames. Recent generative models for videos
   face the problem of high computational requirements. Some models require

   we address this problem via modeling the dynamics in a latent space.
   After the transformation of frames into the latent space, our model
   predicts latent representation for the next frames in an autoregressive
   manner. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on BAIR Robot

Title = {{Data-driven model for hydraulic fracturing design optimization: focus on
   building digital database and production forecast}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Growing amount of hydraulic fracturing (HF) jobs in the recent two
   decades resulted in a significant amount of measured data available for
   development of predictive models via machine learning (ML). In
   multistage fractured completions, post-fracturing production analysis
   (e.g., from production logging tools) reveals evidence that different
   stages produce very non-uniformly, and up to 30\% may not be producing
   at all due to a combination of geomechanics and fracturing design
   factors. Hence, there is a significant room for improvement of current
   design practices. We propose a data-driven model for fracturing design
   optimization, where the workflow is essentially split into two stages.
   As a result of the first stage, the present paper summarizes the efforts
   in the creation of a digital database of field data from several
   thousands of multistage HF jobs on vertical, inclined and
   near-horizontal wells from circa 20 different oilfields in Western
   Siberia, Russia. In terms of the number of points (fracturing jobs), the
   present database is a rare case of a representative dataset of about
   5000 data points, compared to typical databases available in the
   literature, comprising tens or hundreds of points at best. Each point in
   the data base contains the vector of 92 input variables (the reservoir,
   well and the frac design parameters) and the vector of production data,
   which is characterized by 16 parameters, including the target,
   cumulative oil production. The focus is made on data gathering from
   various sources, data preprocessing and development of the architecture
   of the database as well as solving the production forecast problem via
   ML. Data preparation has been done using various ML techniques: the
   problem of missing values in the database is solved with collaborative
   filtering for data imputation; outliers are removed using visualization
   of cluster data structure by t-SNE algorithm. The production forecast
   problem is solved via CatBoost algorithm. Prediction capability of the
   model is measured with the coefficient of determination (R-2) and

Abstract = {{During directional drilling, a bit may sometimes go to a nonproductive
   rock layer due to the gap about 20 m between the bit and high-fidelity
   rock-type sensors. The only way to detect the lithotype changes in time
   is the usage of measurements while drilling (MWD). However, there are no
   general mathematical modeling approaches that both well reconstruct the
   rock type based on MWD data and correspond to specifics of the oil and
   gas industry. In this letter, we present a data-driven procedure that
   utilizes MWD data for quick detection of changes in rock types. We
   propose the approach that combines traditional machine learning (ML)
   based on the solution of the rock-type classification problem with
   change detection procedures rarely used before in oil and gas industry.
   The data come from a newly developed oilfield in the north of western
   Siberia. The results suggest that we can detect a significant part of
   changes in rock types, reducing the change detection delay from 20 to
   1.8 m and the number of false-positive alarms from 43 to 6 per well.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel multi-texture synthesis model based on generative
   adversarial networks (GANs) with a user-controllable mechanism. The user
   control ability allows to explicitly specify the texture which should be
   generated by the model. This property follows from using an encoder part
   which learns a latent representation for each texture from the dataset.
   To ensure a dataset coverage, we use an adversarial loss function that
   penalizes for incorrect reproductions of a given texture. In
   experiments, we show that our model can learn descriptive texture
   manifolds for large datasets and from raw data such as a collection of
   high-resolution photos. We show our unsupervised learning pipeline may
   help segmentation models. Moreover, we apply our method to produce 3D
   textures and show that it outperforms existing baselines.}},

   keypoint-based approach for 3D object detection and localization from a
   single RGB image. We build our multi-branch model around 2D keypoint
   detection in images and complement it with a conceptually simple
   geometric reasoning method. Our network performs in an end-to-end
   manner, simultaneously and interdependently estimating 2D
   characteristics, such as 2D bounding boxes, keypoints, and orientation,
   along with full 3D pose in the scene. We fuse the outputs of distinct
   branches, applying a reprojection consistency loss during training. The

Abstract = {{Constructing high-quality generative models for 3D shapes is a
   fundamental task in computer vision with diverse applications in
   geometry processing, engineering, and design. Despite the recent
   progress in deep generative modelling, synthesis of finely detailed 3D
   surfaces, such as high-resolution point clouds, from scratch has not
   been achieved with existing learning-based approaches. In this work, we
   propose to employ the latent-space Laplacian pyramid representation
   within a hierarchical generative model for 3D point clouds. We combine
   the latent-space GAN and Laplacian GAN architectures proposed in the
   recent years to form a multi-scale model capable of generating 3D point
   clouds at increasing levels of detail. Our initial evaluation
   demonstrates that our model outperforms the existing generative models
   for 3D point clouds, emphasizing the need for an in-depth comparative
   study on the topic of multi-stage generative learning with point clouds.}},

   conjunction with any optimization algorithm that is usually utilized in

Abstract = {{The eSports industry has greatly evolved within the last decade.
   Professional eSports players have contracts with teams, perform daily
   routine training activities, and participate in tournaments. At the same
   time, similar to typical sportsmen, the eSports athletes suffer from
   injuries that significantly reduce their performance or even prevent
   them from participating in the training process or tournaments. Also, it
   is not a trivial task to evaluate the eSports athlete's performance in
   the training process or when hiring a new team member. In this study, we
   address these two issues. We use EEG recording to monitor the subject's
   performance status and use machine learning to find the correlation
   between EEG recordings and eSports athletes' performance. Professional
   eSports players and casual players (10 players from each group)
   participated in gaming sessions of 20 minutes while the EEG recordings
   were collected before and after the game for 10 minutes every time.
   After filtering and removing artifacts, we collected the statistical
   difference before and after the game and used them as the features for
   two binary classification problems: player professionalism and player
   health state. Our results demonstrated that machine learning models
   trained on EEG data can detect professional players with 95\% F1-score
   and detect player health state with 90\% F1-score on 10-fold
   cross-validation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel technique for assessing the dynamics of multiphase
   fluid flow in the oil reservoir. We demonstrate an efficient workflow
   for handling the 3D reservoir simulation data in a way which is orders
   of magnitude faster than the conventional routine. The workflow (we call
   it ``Metamodel{''}) is based on a projection of the system dynamics into
   a latent variable space, using Variational Autoencoder model, where
   Recurrent Neural Network predicts the dynamics. We show that being
   trained on multiple results of the conventional reservoir modelling, the
   Metamodel does not compromise the accuracy of the reservoir dynamics
   reconstruction in a significant way. It allows forecasting not only the
   flow rates from the wells, but also the dynamics of pressure and fluid
   saturations within the reservoir. The results open a new perspective in
   the optimization of oilfield development as the scenario screening could
   be accelerated sufficiently.}},

   counterpart, Steganalysis, is the practice of determining if a message

Title = {{A predictive model for steady-state multiphase pipe flow: Machine
   learning on lab data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{727-746}},

Abstract = {{Engineering simulators used for steady-state multiphase flows in oil and
   gas wells and pipelines are commonly utilized to predict pressure drop
   and phase velocities. Such simulators are typically based on either
   empirical correlations (e.g., Beggs and Brill, Mukherjee and Brill, Duns
   and Ros) or first-principles mechanistic models (e.g., Ansari, Xiao,
   TUFFP Unified, Leda Flow Point model, OLGAS). The simulators allow one
   to evaluate the pressure drop in a multiphase pipe flow with acceptable
   accuracy. However, the only shortcoming of these correlations and
   mechanistic models is their applicability (besides steady-state versions
   of transient simulators such as Leda Flow and OLGA). Empirical
   correlations are commonly applicable in their respective ranges of data
   fitting; and mechanistic models are limited by the applicability of the
   empirically based closure relations that are a part of such models. In
   order to extend the applicability and the accuracy of the existing
   accessible methods, a method of pressure drop calculation in the
   pipeline is proposed. The method is based on well segmentation and
   calculation of the pressure gradient in each segment using three
   surrogate models based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms trained on a
   representative lab data set from the open literature. The first model
   predicts the value of a liquid holdup in the segment, the second one
   determines the flow pattern, and the third one is used to estimate the
   pressure gradient. To build these models, several ML algorithms are
   trained such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Support
   Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, and their predictive
   abilities are cross-compared. The proposed method for pressure gradient
   calculation yields R-2 = 0.95 by using the Gradient Boosting algorithm
   as compared with R-2 = 0.92 in case of Mukherjee and Brill correlation
   and R-2 = 0.91 when a combination of Ansari and Xiao mechanistic models
   is utilized. The application of the above-mentioned ML algorithms and
   the larger database used for their training will allow extending the
   proposed methodology to a wider applicability range of input parameters
   as compared to standard accessible techniques. The method for pressure
   drop prediction based on ML algorithms trained on lab data is also
   validated on three real field cases. Validation indicates that the
   proposed model yields the following coefficients of determination: R-2 =
   0.806, 0.815 and 0.99 as compared with the highest values obtained by
   commonly used techniques: R-2 = 0.82 (Beggs and Brill correlation),
   (Mukherjee and Brill correlation) and R-2 = 0.98 (Beggs and Brill
   correlation). Hence, the method for calculating the pressure
   distribution could give comparable or even higher scores on field data
   by contrast to correlations and mechanistic models. This fact is an
   indicator that the model can be scalable from the lab to the field
   conditions without any additional retraining of ML algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have recently
   demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the ordinary
   methods. Nevertheless, these methods are inapplicable for small

Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{506-516}},

Abstract = {{Directional oil well drilling requires high precision of the wellbore
   positioning inside the productive area. However, due to specifics of
   engineering design, sensors that explicitly determine the type of the
   drilled rock are located farther than 15m from the drilling bit. As a
   result, the target area runaways can be detected only after this
   distance, which in turn, leads to a loss in well productivity and the
   risk of the need for an expensive reboring operation.
   We present a novel approach for identifying rock type at the drilling
   bit based on machine learning classification methods and data mining on
   sensors readings. We compare various machine-learning algorithms,
   examine extra features coming from mathematical modeling of drilling
   mechanics, and show that the real-time rock type classification error
   can be reduced from 13.5\% to 9\%. The approach is applicable for
   precise directional drilling in relatively thin target intervals of
   complex shapes and generalizes appropriately to new wells that are
   different from the ones used for training the machine learning model.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the growing importance of geospatial data, its analysis
   including semantic segmentation becomes an increasingly popular task in
   computer vision today. Convolutional neural networks are powerful visual
   models that yield hierarchies of features and practitioners widely use
   them to process remote sensing data. When performing remote sensing
   image segmentation, multiple instances of one class with precisely
   defined boundaries are often the case, and it is crucial to extract
   those boundaries accurately. The accuracy of segments boundaries
   delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented areas
   explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as
   BCE, IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries
   sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely a
   differentiable surrogate of a metric accounting accuracy of boundary
   detection. We can use the loss function with any neural network for
   binary segmentation. We performed validation of our loss function with
   various modifications of UNet on a synthetic dataset, as well as using
   real-world data (ISPRS Potsdam, INRIA AIL). Trained with the proposed
   loss function, models outperform baseline methods in terms of IoU score.}},

Abstract = {{Data-driven methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
   known to deliver state-of-the-art performance on image recognition tasks
   when the training data are abundant. However, in some instances, such as
   change detection in remote sensing images, annotated data cannot be
   obtained in sufficient quantities. In this work, we propose a simple and
   efficient method for creating realistic targeted synthetic datasets in
   the remote sensing domain, leveraging the opportunities offered by game
   development engines. We provide a description of the pipeline for
   procedural geometry generation and rendering as well as an evaluation of
   the efficiency of produced datasets in a change detection scenario. Our
   evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline helps to improve the
   performance and convergence of deep learning models when the amount of
   real-world data is severely limited.}},

Abstract = {{We construct a classification model, that predicts if an earthquake with
   the magnitude above a threshold will take place at a given location in a
   time range 30-180 days from now. A common approach is to use
   expert-generated features like Region-Time-Length (RTL) features as an
   input to the model. The proposed approach aggregates of multiple
   generated RTL features to take into account effects at various scales
   and to improve the quality of a machine learning model. For our data on
   Japan earthquakes 1992-2005 and predictions at locations given in this

Abstract = {{Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a recent approach to analyze data
   sets from the perspective of their topological structure. Its use for
   time series data has been limited. In this work, a system developed for
   a leading provider of cloud computing combining both user segmentation
   and demand forecasting is presented. It consists of a TDA-based
   clustering method for time series inspired by a popular managerial
   framework for customer segmentation and extended to the case of
   clusterwise regression using matrix factorization methods to forecast
   demand. Increasing customer loyalty and producing accurate forecasts
   remain active topics of discussion both for researchers and managers.
   Using a public and a novel proprietary data set of commercial data, this
   research shows that the proposed system enables analysts to both cluster
   their user base and plan demand at a granular level with significantly
   higher accuracy than a state of the art baseline. This work thus seeks
   to introduce TDA-based clustering of time series and clusterwise
   regression with matrix factorization methods as viable tools for the
   practitioner.}},

Abstract = {{Build-to-order (BTO) supply chains have become commonplace in industries
   such as electronics, automotive and fashion. They enable building
   products based on individual requirements with a short lead time and
   minimum inventory and production costs. Due to their nature, they differ
   significantly from traditional supply chains. However, there have not
   been studies dedicated to demand forecasting methods for this type of
   setting. This work makes two contributions. First, it presents a new and
   unique data set from a manufacturer in the BTO sector. Second, it
   proposes a novel data transformation technique for demand forecasting of
   BTO products. Results from thirteen forecasting methods show that the
   approach compares well to the state-of-the-art while being easy to
   implement and to explain to decision-makers.}},

Abstract = {{One possible approach to tackle the class imbalance in classification
   tasks is to resample a training dataset, i.e., to drop some of its
   elements or to synthesize new ones. There exist several widely-used
   resampling methods. Recent research showed that the choice of resampling
   method significantly affects the quality of classification, which raises
   the resampling selection problem. Exhaustive search for optimal
   resampling is time-consuming and hence it is of limited use. In this
   paper, we describe an alternative approach to the resampling selection.
   We follow the meta-learning concept to build resampling recommendation
   systems, i.e., algorithms recommending resampling for datasets on the
   basis of their properties.}},

   conventional reservoir modeling and illustrate that ANN-based model (1)
   is able to capture all the output parameters of the conventional model

   performance. We finally elaborate on further options for research and

Abstract = {{Using highly interactive systems like computer games requires a lot of
   visual activity and eye movements. Eye movements are best characterized
   by visual fixation - periods of time when the eyes stay relatively still
   over an object. We analyzed the distributions of fixation duration of
   professional athletes, amateur and newbie players. We show that the
   analysis of fixation durations can be used to deduce the skill level in
   computer game players. Highly skilled gaming performance is
   characterized by more variability in fixation durations and by bimodal
   fixation duration distributions suggesting the presence of two fixation
   types in high skill gamers. These fixation types were identified as
   ambient (automatic spatial processing) and focal (conscious visual
   processing). The analysis of computer gamers' skill level via the
   analysis of fixation durations may be used in developing adaptive
   interfaces and in interface design.}},

Abstract = {{RGBD images, combining high-resolution color and lower-resolution depth
   from various types of depth sensors, are increasingly common. One can
   significantly improve the resolution of depth maps by taking advantage
   of color information; deep learning methods make combining color and
   depth information particularly easy.
   However, fusing these two sources of data may lead to a variety of
   artifacts. If depth maps are used to reconstruct 3D shapes, e.g., for
   virtual reality applications, the visual quality of upsampled images is
   particularly important.
   The main idea of our approach is to measure the quality of depth map
   upsampling using renderings of resulting 3D surfaces. We demonstrate
   that a simple visual appearance-based loss, when used with either a
   trained CNN or simply a deep prior, yields significantly improved 3D
   shapes, as measured by a number of existing perceptual metrics. We
   compare this approach with a number of existing optimization and
   learning-based techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Most current state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms use images
   captured by cameras, which operate in the visible spectral range as
   input data. Thus, image recognition systems that build on top of those
   algorithms can not provide acceptable recognition quality in poor
   lighting conditions, e.g. during nighttime. Another significant
   limitation of such systems is high demand for computational resources,
   which makes them impossible to use on low-powered embedded systems
   without GPU support. This work attempts to create an algorithm for
   pattern recognition that will consolidate data from visible and infrared
   spectral ranges and allow near real-time performance on embedded systems
   with infrared and visible sensors. First, we analyze existing methods of
   combining data from different spectral ranges for object detection task.
   Based on the analysis, an architecture of a deep convolutional neural
   network is proposed for the fusion of multi-spectral data. This
   architecture is based on the single shot multi-box detection algorithm.
   Comparison analysis of the proposed architecture with previously
   proposed solutions for the multi-spectral object detection task shows
   comparable or better detection accuracy with previous algorithms and
   significant improvement of the running time on embedded systems. This
   study was conducted in collaboration with Philips Lighting Research Lab
   and solutions based on the proposed architecture will be used in image
   recognition systems for the next generation of intelligent lighting
   systems. Thus, the main scientific outcomes of this work include an
   algorithm for multi-spectral pattern recognition based on convolutional
   neural networks, as well as a modification of detection algorithms for
   working on embedded systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, machine learning has become one of the basic technologies used
   in solving various computer vision tasks such as feature detection,
   image segmentation, object recognition and tracking. In many
   applications, various complex systems such as robots are equipped with
   visual sensors from which they learn state of surrounding environment by
   solving corresponding computer vision tasks. Solutions of these tasks
   are used for making decisions about possible future actions. It is not
   surprising that when solving computer vision tasks we should take into
   account special aspects of their subsequent application in model-based
   predictive control. Reinforcement learning is one of modern machine
   learning technologies in which learning is carried out through
   interaction with the environment. In recent years, Reinforcement
   learning has been used both for solving such applied tasks as processing
   and analysis of visual information, and for solving specific computer
   vision problems such as filtering, extracting image features, localizing
   objects in scenes, and many others. The paper describes shortly the
   Reinforcement learning technology and its use for solving computer
   vision problems.}},

Abstract = {{Influence Maximization problem has found numerous applications in the
   real world and attracted a lot of research in the recent years. However,
   all previous attempts to provide a solution were based solely on the
   graph topology. Instead, we show how to employ recent advancement in
   representation learning and use node embeddings for finding solution as
   a supervised task. In our experiments, we show that the ranked list of
   nodes obtained by classifier yields better influence completion set than
   other baselines.}},

Abstract = {{The task of representing entire graphs has seen a surge of prominent
   results, mainly due to learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on
   graph-structured data. While CNNs demonstrate state-of-the-art
   performance in graph classification task, such methods are supervised
   and therefore steer away from the original problem of network
   representation in task-agnostic manner. Here, we coherently propose an
   approach for embedding entire graphs and show that our feature
   representations with SVM classifier increase classification accuracy of
   CNN algorithms and traditional graph kernels. For this we describe a
   recently discovered graph object, anonymous walk, on which we design
   task-independent algorithms for learning graph representations in
   explicit and distributed way. Overall, our work represents a new
   scalable unsupervised learning of state-of-the-art representations of
   entire graphs.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering tools allowing pressure gradient calculation in the pipe
   segment commonly use stationary correlation and mechanistic models such
   as Beggs and Brill, Ansary, etc. This is well known and convenient way
   which gives rough estimate of pressure gradient due to friction losses
   and liquid phase interference. It avoids solving complex dynamic
   pressure equation and derives quick results with comfortable precision
   margin for large scale systems, such as horizontal pipes and wells. In
   order to enlarge the applicability zone and accuracy of existing
   methods, a new method of pressure gradient definition is evolved. It is
   included three surrogate models that are based on Machine Learning (ML)
   algorithms. The first model predicts liquid holdup in the segment, the
   second defines flow pattern and the third predicts pressure gradient. In
   order to create these models, several ML algorithms are applied such as
   Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine and Artificial
   Neuron Network.
   Involvement of the latest machine learning algorithms will allow
   applying this method to wider range of input data compared with standard
   multiphase flow correlations and mechanistic models. The proposed method
   demonstrates high accuracy - on the collected experimental data set it
   gives R-2 = 0:985 for pressure gradient prediction. That is why it could
   help to carry out correct calculation of bottom hole pressure and
   pressure distribution along the length of the pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear multi-output regression problem is to construct a predictive
   function which estimates an unknown smooth mapping from q-dimensional
   inputs to m-dimensional outputs based on a training data set consisting
   of given ``input-output{''} pairs. In order to solve this problem,
   regression models based on stationary kernels are often used. However,
   such approaches are not efficient for functions with strongly varying
   gradients. There exist some attempts to introduce non-stationary kernels
   to account for possible non-regularities, although even the most
   efficient one called Manifold Learning Regression (MLR), which estimates
   the unknown function as well its Jacobian matrix, is too computationally
   expensive. The main problem is that the MLR is based on a
   computationally intensive manifold learning technique. In this paper we
   propose a modified version of the MLR with significantly less
   computational complexity while preserving its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of psychoneurology, analysis of neuroimaging data aimed at
   extracting distinctive patterns of pathologies, such as epilepsy and
   depression, is well known to represent a challenging problem. As the
   resolution and acquisition rates of modern medical scanners rise, the
   need to automatically capture complex spatiotemporal patterns in large
   imaging arrays suggests using automated approaches to pattern
   recognition in volumetric images, such as training a classification
   models using deep learning. On the other hand, with typically scarce
   training data, the choice of a particular neural network architecture
   remains an unresolved issue. In this work, we evaluate off-the-shelf
   building blocks of deep voxelwise neural architectures with the goal of
   learning robust decision rules in computational psychiatry. To this end,
   we carry out a series of computational experiments, aiming at the
   recognition of epilepsy and depression on structural (3D) and functional
   (4D) MRI data. We discover that our investigated models perform on par
   with computational approaches known in literature, without the need for
   sophisticated preprocessing and feature extraction.}},

Abstract = {{This research article suggests that there are significant benefits in
   exposing demand planners to forecasting methods using matrix completion
   techniques. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of
   the field of forecasting with multivariate time series prediction by
   focusing on the dimension of large commercial data sets with
   hierarchies. This research highlights that there has neither been
   sufficient academic research in this sub- field nor dissemination among
   practitioners in the business sector. This study seeks to innovate by
   presenting a matrix completion method for short-term demand forecast of
   time series data on relevant commercial problems. Albeit computing
   intensive, this method outperforms the state of the art while remaining
   accessible to business users. The object of research is matrix
   completion for time series in a big data context within the industry.
   The subject of the research is forecasting product demand using
   techniques for multivariate hierarchical time series prediction that are
   both precise and accessible to non-technical business experts. Apart
   from a methodological innovation, this research seeks to introduce
   practitioners to novel methods for hierarchical multivariate time series
   prediction. The research outcome is of interest for organizations
   requiring precise forecasts yet lacking the appropriate human capital to
   develop them.}},

Abstract = {{In current work we propose a three-step approach to automatic and
   efficient functional brain areas mapping as well demonstrate in case
   studies on three patients with gliomas the potential applicability of
   constrained source separation technique (semiblind Independent Component
   Analysis, ICA) to brain networks discovery and the similarity of
   task-based-fMRI (t-fMRI) and resting state-fMRI (rs-fMRI) results.
   Blind and semiblind ICA-analysis was applied for both methods t-fMRI and
   rs-fMRI. To measure similarity between spatial maps we used Dice
   coefficient, which shows the ratio of overlapping voxels and all active
   voxels in two compared maps for each patient
   Based on the analysis of Dice coefficients, there was a fairly high
   degree of overlap between the t-fMRI active areas, Broca and Wernicke
   and the language network obtained from rs-fMRI. The degree of motor
   areas overlap with sensorimotor network is less pronounced, but the
   activation sites correspond to anatomical landmarks - a complex of
   central gyri and supplementary motor area. In general, in comparisons of
   the functional brain areas obtained with t-fMRI and rs-fMRI, there is a
   greater specificity of semiblind ICA compared to blind ICA.
   Resting-state networks of interest (motor and language) discovered by
   rs-fMRI highly correlate with t-fMRI reference and are located in
   anticipated anatomical regions. As a result, rs-fMRI maps seem as a good
   approximation of t-fMRI maps, especially in case of semiblind ICA
   decomposition.
   We hope that further our research of individual changes in sensorimotor
   and language networks based on functional rs-MRI will allow predicting
   the activity of neural network architectures and non-invasive mapping of
   functional areas for preoperative planning.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been known that patients with depression exhibit abnormal
   brain functional connectivity patterns, that are often studied from a
   graph-theoretic perspective. However, while certain simpler graph
   features have been examined, little has been done in the direction of
   advanced feature learning methodologies such as network embeddings. Our
   work aims to extend the understanding of importance of graph-based
   features for medical applications by evaluating the recently proposed
   anonymous walk embeddings (AWE) in difficult depression classification
   problems. For two challenging datasets, we obtain performance gains and
   investigate the learned vector representations. Our results indicate
   that using AWE-based features is a promising new direction for medical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{As machine learning continues to gain momentum in the neuroscience
   community, we witness the emergence of novel applications such as
   diagnostics, characterization, and treatment outcome prediction for
   psychiatric and neurological disorders, for instance, epilepsy and
   depression. Systematic research into these mental disorders increasingly
   involves drawing clinical conclusions on the basis of data-driven
   approaches; to this end, structural and functional neuroimaging serve as
   key source modalities. Identification of informative neuroimaging
   markers requires establishing a comprehensive preparation pipeline for
   data which may be severely corrupted by artifactual signal fluctuations.
   We propose a new unified data analysis pipeline for neuroimaging-based
   diagnostic classification problems using various different feature
   extraction techniques, Machine Learning algorithms and processing
   toolboxes for brain imaging. We illustrate the approach by discovering
   potential candidates for new biomarkers for diagnostics of epilepsy and
   depression presence in simple and complex cases based on clinical and
   MRI data for patients and healthy volunteers. We also demonstrate that
   the proposed pipeline in many classification tasks provides better
   performance than conventional ones.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of malfunction sensors is an important problem in the field of
   Internet of Things. One of the classical approaches to recognize
   anomalous patterns in sensor data is to use anomaly detection techniques
   based on One Class Classification like Support Vector Data Description
   or One Class Support Vector Machine. These techniques allow to build a
   ``geometrical{''} model of a sensor regular operating state using
   historical data and detect broken sensors based on a distance to the
   regular data patterns. Usually important signals/warnings, which can
   help to identify broken sensors, arrive only after their failures. In
   this paper, we propose the approach to utilize such data by using the
   privileged information paradigm: we incorporate signals/warnings,
   available only when training the anomaly detection model, to refine the
   location of the boundary, separating the anomalous region. We
   demonstrate the approach by solving the problem of broken sensor
   detection in a Road Weather Information System.}},

Abstract = {{Global sensitivity analysis aims at quantifying respective effects of
   input random variables (or combinations thereof) onto variance of a
   physical or mathematical model response. Among the abundant literature
   on sensitivity measures, Sobol indices have received much attention
   since they provide accurate information for most of models. We consider
   a problem of experimental design points selection for Sobol' indices
   estimation. Based on the concept of D-optimality, we propose a method
   for constructing an adaptive design of experiments, effective for
   calculation of Sobol' indices based on Polynomial Chaos Expansions. We
   provide a set of applications that demonstrate the efficiency of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Engineers widely use Gaussian process regression framework to construct
   surrogate models aimed to replace computationally expensive physical
   models while exploring design space. Thanks to Gaussian process
   properties we can use both samples generated by a high fidelity function
   (an expensive and accurate representation of a physical phenomenon) and
   a low fidelity function (a cheap and coarse approximation of the same
   physical phenomenon) while constructing a surrogate model. However, if
   samples sizes are more than few thousands of points, computational costs
   of the Gaussian process regression become prohibitive both in case of
   learning and in case of prediction calculation. We propose two
   approaches to circumvent this computational burden: one approach is
   based on the Nystrom approximation of sample covariance matrices and
   another is based on an intelligent usage of a blackbox that can evaluate
   a low fidelity function on the fly at any point of a design space. We
   examine performance of the proposed approaches using a number of
   artificial and real problems, including engineering optimization of a
   rotating disk shape.}},

Abstract = {{Yield of protein per translated mRNA may vary by four orders of
   magnitude. Many studies analyzed the influence of mRNA features on the
   translation yield. However, a detailed understanding of how mRNA
   sequence determines its propensity to be translated is still missing.
   Here, we constructed a set of reporter plasmid libraries encoding CER
   fluorescent protein preceded by randomized 5' untranslated regions
   (5'-UTR) and Red fluorescent protein (RFP) used as an internal control.
   Each library was transformed into Escherchia coli cells, separated by
   efficiency of CER mRNA translation by a cell sorter and subjected to
   next generation sequencing. We tested efficiency of translation of the
   CER gene preceded by each of 48 natural 5'-UTR sequences and introduced
   random and designed mutations into natural and artificially selected
   5'-UTRs. Several distinct properties could be ascribed to a group of
   5'-UTRs most efficient in translation. In addition to known ones,
   several previously unrecognized features that contribute to the
   translation enhancement were found, such as low proportion of cytidine
   residues, multiple SD sequences and AG repeats. The latter could be
   identified as translation enhancer, albeit less efficient than SD
   sequence in several natural 5'-UTRs.}},

Abstract = {{The SHiP experiment is designed to search for very weakly interacting
   particles beyond the Standard Model which are produced in a 400 GeV/c
   proton beam dump at the CERN SPS. The critical challenge for this
   experiment is to keep the Standard Model background level negligible. In
   the beam dump, around 10(11) muons will be produced per second. The muon
   rate in the spectrometer has to be reduced by at least four orders of
   magnitude to avoid muon-induced backgrounds. It is demonstrated that new
   improved active muon shield may be used to magnetically deflect the
   muons out of the acceptance of the spectrometer.}},

Abstract = {{An appearance-based robot self-localization problem is considered in the
   machine learning framework. The appearance space is composed of all
   possible images, which can be captured by a robot's visual system under
   all robot localizations. Using recent manifold learning and deep
   learning techniques, we propose a new geometrically motivated solution
   based on training data consisting of a finite set of images captured in
   known locations of the robot. The solution includes estimation of the
   robot localization mapping from the appearance space to the robot
   localization space, as well as estimation of the inverse mapping for
   modeling visual image features. The latter allows solving the robot
   localization problem as the Kalman filtering problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that there has not been enough discussion in the field
   of applications of Gaussian Process for the fast moving consumer goods
   industry. Yet, this technique can be important as it e.g., can provide
   automatic feature relevance determination and the posterior mean can
   unlock insights on the data. Significant challenges are the large size
   and high dimensionality of commercial data at a point of sale. The study
   reviews approaches in the Gaussian Processes modeling for large data
   sets, evaluates their performance on commercial sales and shows value of
   this type of models as a decision-making tool for management.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering problems often involve data sources of variable fidelity
   with different costs of obtaining an observation. In particular, one can
   use both a cheap low fidelity function (e.g. a computational experiment
   with a CFD code) and an expensive high fidelity function (e.g. a wind
   tunnel experiment) to generate a data sample in order to construct a
   regression model of a high fidelity function. The key question in this
   setting is how the sizes of the high and low fidelity data samples
   should be selected in order to stay within a given computational budget
   and maximize accuracy of the regression model prior to committing
   resources on data acquisition.
   In this paper we obtain minimax interpolation errors for single and
   variable fidelity scenarios for a multivariate Gaussian process
   regression. Evaluation of the minimax errors allows us to identify cases
   when the variable fidelity data provides better interpolation accuracy
   than the exclusively high fidelity data for the same computational
   budget. These results allow us to calculate the optimal shares of
   variable fidelity data samples under the given computational budget
   constraint. Real and synthetic data experiments suggest that using the
   obtained optimal shares often outperforms natural heuristics in terms of
   the regression accuracy.}},
