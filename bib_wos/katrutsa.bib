Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimality of the restriction and prolongation
   operators in the geometric multigrid method (GMG). GMG is used in
   solving discretized partial differential equation (PDE) and it relies
   greatly on the restriction and prolongation operators. Many methods to
   find these operators were proposed, but most of them have limited
   optimality proofs. To study their optimality we introduce stochastic
   convergence functional, which estimates the spectral radius of the
   iteration matrix for given GMG parameters. We implement the GMG method
   in a modern machine learning framework that can automatically compute
   the gradients of the introduced convergence functional with respect to
   restriction and prolongation operators. Therefore, we can minimize the
   proposed functional starting from some initial parameters and get better
   ones after some iterations of stochastic gradient descent. To illustrate
   the performance of the proposed approach, we carry out experiments on
   the discretized Poisson equation, Helmholtz equation and singularly
   perturbed convection-diffusion equation and demonstrate that proposed
   approach gives operators, which lead to faster convergence. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Purpose The full understanding of the effect of mineral waste-based
   fertilizer in soil is still unrelieved, because of the extreme complex
   chemical composition and plethora of their action pathways. The purposes
   of this paper is to quantify the input of PG into the soil ecosystem
   process, considering the direct effects of PG as a whole on soil
   environment using of a plethora of chemical, toxicological, and
   biological tests.
   Materials and methods Greenhouse experiment includes different PG doses
   (0, 1\%, 3\%, 7.5\%, 15\%, 25\%, and 40\%) and two-time collection
   points after treatments-7 and 28 days. For each treatment and each time
   collection point, we measure (i) soil pH, bioavailable (H(2)0 and
   NH4COOH-extractable) element content (S, P, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Sr,
   Ba, F); (ii) soil enzyme activities-dehydrogenase, urease, acid
   phosphatase, FDA; (iii) soil CO2 respiration activity with and without
   glucose addition; (iv) Eisenia fetida, Sinapis alba, and Avena sativa
   responses. Finally, we combine the ordinary chemical, toxicology, and
   biological measuring of soil properties with state-of-the-art
   mathematical analysis, namely (i) support vector machines (used for
   prediction), (ii) mutual information test (variable importance tasks),
   (iii) t-SNE and LLE algorithms (used for unsupervised classification).
   Results and discussion The results show similarity between the 0\%, 1\%,
   and 3\% PG treatments in all collection times based on the toxicological
   and biological properties. Beyond 7.5\% PG, some biological test was
   significantly inhibited in response to trace element stress. Among all
   tested parameters, soil urease activities, soil respiration activities
   after glucose addition, S. alba root lengths, and E. fetida survival
   rates show sensitivity to PG addition. Furthermore, the machine learning
   algorithms revealed that only several elements (mobile and water-soluble
   forms of Ca, Ba, Sr, S, and Na; water-soluble F) could be responsible to
   elevated soil toxicity for those indicators. SVR models were able to
   predict soil biological and ecotoxicity properties, and increasing
   numbers of randomly selected training examples from 50 to 90\% of
   initial experimental data significantly improved model performance.
   Conclusions At this study, we demonstrate benefits of unsupervised
   machine learning methods for investigating toxicity of man-made
   substances in soil that can be further applied to risk assessments of
   various toxins, which are of significant interest to environmental
   protection.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive study of feature selection methods to solve
   multicollinearity problem according to evaluation criteria}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a new approach to feature selection based on the
   concept of feature filters, so that feature selection is independent of
   the prediction model. Data fitting is stated as a single-objective
   optimization problem, where the objective function indicates the error
   of approximating the target vector as some function of given features.
   Linear dependence between features induces the multicollinearity problem
   and leads to instability of the model and redundancy of the feature set.
   This paper introduces a feature selection method based on quadratic
   programming. This approach takes into account the mutual dependence of
   the features and the target vector, and selects features according to
   relevance and similarity measures defined according to the specific
   problem. The main idea is to minimize mutual dependence and maximize
   approximation quality by varying a binary vector that indicates the
   presence of features. The selected model is less redundant and more
   stable. To evaluate the quality of the proposed feature selection method
   and compare it with others, we use several criteria to measure
   instability and redundancy. In our experiments, we compare the proposed
   approach with several other feature selection methods, and show that the
   quadratic programming approach gives superior results according to the
   criteria considered for the test and real data sets. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{SimRank is a well-known similarity measure between graph vertices. This
   measure relies on a graph topology and is built on the intuition that
   `two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects'.
   Formalization of this intuition leads to a system of linear equations,
   so large that even the solution vector will not fit in the RAM for many
   real-world graphs. To solve this issue we propose a new method based on
   a low-rank approximation of the linear system solution. This approach
   requires less memory and provides a significant calculation speed-up.
   The experiments show that the proposed method provides an accurate
   SimRank approximation.}},
