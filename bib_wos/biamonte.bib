Abstract = {{The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is the most
   studied gate-based variational quantum algorithm today. We train QAOA
   one layer at a time to maximize overlap with an n qubit target state.
   Doing so we discovered that such training always saturates-called
   training saturation-at some depth p{*}, meaning that past a certain
   depth, overlap cannot be improved by adding subsequent layers. We
   formulate necessary conditions for saturation. Numerically, we find
   layerwise QAOA reaches its maximum overlap at depth p{*} = n for the
   problem of state preparation. The addition of coherent dephasing errors
   to training removes saturation, recovering robustness to layerwise
   training. This study sheds new light on the performance limitations and
   prospects of QAOA.}},

Abstract = {{The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has become a
   cornerstone of contemporary quantum applications development. Here we
   show that the density of problem constraints versus problem variables
   acts as a performance indicator. Density is found to correlate strongly
   with approximation inefficiency for fixed depth QAOA applied to random
   graph minimization problem instances. Further, the required depth for
   accurate QAOA solution to graph problem instances scales critically with
   density. Motivated by Google's recent experimental realization of QAOA,
   we preform a reanalysis of the reported data reproduced in an ideal
   noiseless setting. We found that the reported capabilities of instances
   addressed experimentally by Google, approach a rapid fall-off region in
   approximation quality experienced beyond intermediate-density. Our

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Implementing variational quantum algorithms with noisy
   intermediate-scale quantum machines of up to a hundred qubits is
   nowadays considered as one of the most promising routes towards
   achieving a quantum practical advantage. In multiqubit circuits, running
   advanced quantum algorithms is hampered by the noise inherent to quantum
   gates which distances us from the idea of universal quantum computing.
   Based on a one-dimensional quantum spin chain with competing symmetric
   and asymmetric pairwise exchange interactions, herein we discuss the
   capabilities of quantum algorithms with special attention paid to a
   hardware-efficient variational eigensolver. A delicate interplay between
   magnetic interactions allows one to stabilize a chiral state that
   destroys the homogeneity of magnetic ordering, thus making this solution
   highly entangled. Quantifying entanglement in terms of quantum
   concurrence, we argue that, while being capable of correctly reproducing
   a uniform magnetic configuration, the hardware-efficient Ansatz meets
   difficulties in providing a detailed description to a noncollinear
   magnetic structure. The latter naturally limits the application range of
   variational quantum computing to solve quantum simulation tasks.}},

Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has become a
   cornerstone of contemporary quantum applications development. In QAOA, a
   quantum circuit is trained-by repeatedly adjusting circuit parameters-to
   solve a problem instance. Several recent findings have reported
   parameter concentration effects in QAOA and their presence has become
   one of folklore: while empirically observed, the concentrations have not
   been defined and analytical approaches remain scarce, focusing on
   limiting system sizes while neglecting parameter scaling as system size
   increases. We found that optimal QAOA circuit parameters concentrate as
   an inverse polynomial in the problem size, providing an optimistic
   result for improving circuit training Our results are analytically
   demonstrated for QAOA at p = 1, 2 (corresponding to 2 and 4 tunable
   parameters, respectively). The technique is also applicable for higher
   depths wherein the concentration effect is cross verified numerically.
   Parameter concentrations allow for training on a fraction w < n of
   qubits to assert that these parameters are nearly optimal on n qubits,
   thereby reducing training time.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding which physical processes are symmetric with respect to
   time inversion is a ubiquitous problem in physics. In quantum physics,
   effective gauge fields allow emulation of matter under strong magnetic
   fields, realizing the Harper-Hofstadter, the Haldane models,
   demonstrating one-way waveguides and topologically protected edge
   states. Central to these discoveries is the chirality induced by
   time-symmetry breaking. In quantum walk algorithms, recent work has
   discovered implications time-reversal symmetry breaking has on the
   transport of quantum states which has enabled a host of new experimental
   implementations. We provide a full topological classification of
   Hamiltonian operators that do not exhibit symmetry under time-reversal
   with respect to the induced transition probabilities between elements in
   a preferred site-basis, i.e. the nodes of the graph on which the walk
   takes place. We prove that a quantum process is necessarily
   time-symmetric for any choice of time-independent Hamiltonian precisely
   when the underlying support graph is bipartite or no Aharonov-Bohm
   phases are present in the gauge field. We further prove that certain
   bipartite graphs exhibit transition probability suppression, but not
   broken time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, our development of a general
   framework characterizes gauge potentials on combinatorial graphs. These
   results and techniques fill an important missing gap in understanding
   the role this omnipresent effect has in quantum information and

Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Complex systems are large collections of entities that organize
   themselves into non-trivial structures, represented as networks. One of
   their key emergent properties is robustness against random failures or
   targeted attacks -i.e., the networks maintain their integrity under
   removal of nodes or links. Here, we introduce network entanglement to
   study network robustness through a multiscale lens, encoded by the time
   required for information diffusion through the system. Our measure's
   foundation lies upon a recently developed statistical field theory for
   information dynamics within interconnected systems. We show that at the
   smallest temporal scales, the node-network entanglement reduces to
   degree, whereas at extremely large scales, it measures the direct role
   played by each node in keeping the network connected. At the meso-scale,
   entanglement plays a more important role, measuring the importance of
   nodes for the transport properties of the system. We use entanglement as
   a centrality measure capturing the role played by nodes in keeping the
   overall diversity of the information flow. As an application, we study
   the disintegration of empirical social, biological and transportation
   systems, showing that the nodes central for information dynamics are
   also responsible for keeping the network integrated. The dynamics of
   information within complex networks can be captured by a set of
   operators where the effect of detachment of a node defines the
   node-networks entanglement, which can be used as a multiscale centrality
   measure. Here, the authors show that the nodes with high entanglement
   centrality, which are critical for information dynamics, are also the
   ones responsible for keeping the network integrated.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical emulation of quantum physics and quantum chemistry often
   involves an intractable number of degrees of freedom and admits no known

   exponentially more challenging with increasing system size. Recently,
   quantum algorithms implemented as variational models have been proposed
   to accelerate such simulations. Here, we study the effect of noise on
   the quantum phase transition in the Schwinger model within a variational
   framework. The experiments are built using a free space optical scheme
   to realize a pair of polarization qubits and enable any two-qubit state
   to be experimentally prepared up to machine tolerance. We specifically
   exploit the possibility to engineer noise and decoherence for
   polarization qubits to explore the limits of variational algorithms for
   noisy intermediate-scale quantum architectures in identifying and
   quantifying quantum phase transitions with noisy qubits. We find that
   despite the presence of noise, one can detect the phase transition of
   the Schwinger Hamiltonian even for a two-qubit system using variational
   quantum algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Variational quantum algorithms dominate gate-based applications of
   modern quantum processors. The so-called layerwise trainability
   conjecture appears in various works throughout the variational quantum
   computing literature. The conjecture asserts that a quantum circuit can
   be trained piecewise, e.g., that a few layers can be trained in sequence
   to minimize an objective function. Here, we prove this conjecture false.
   Counter-examples are found by considering objective functions that are
   exponentially close (in the number of qubits) to the identity matrix. In
   the finite setting, we found abrupt transitions in the ability of
   quantum circuits to be trained to minimize these objective functions.
   Specifically, we found that below a critical (target-gate-dependent)
   threshold, circuit training terminates close to the identity and remains
   near to the identity for subsequently added blocks trained piecewise. A
   critical layer depth will abruptly train arbitrarily close to the
   target, thereby minimizing the objective function. These findings shed
   light on the divide-and-conquer trainability of variational quantum
   circuits and apply to a wide collection of contemporary literature.}},

Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Variational quantum algorithms dominate contemporary gate-based quantum
   enhanced optimization, eigenvalue estimation, and machine learning. Here
   we establish the quantum computational universality of variational
   quantum computation by developing two objective functions which minimize
   to prepare outputs of arbitrary quantum circuits. The fleeting resource
   of variational quantum computation is the number of expected values
   which must be iteratively minimized using classical-to-quantum outer
   loop optimization. An efficient solution to this optimization problem is
   given by the quantum circuit being simulated itself. The first
   construction is efficient in the number of expected values for n-qubit
   circuits containing O(poly ln n) non-Clifford gates-the number of
   expected values has no dependence on Clifford gates appearing in the
   simulated circuit. The second approach yields O(L-2) expected values
   whereas introducing not more than O(ln L) slack qubits for a quantum
   circuit partitioned into L gates. Hence, the utilitarian variational
   quantum programming procedure-based on the classical evaluation of
   objective functions and iterated feedback-is, in principle, as powerful
   as any other model of quantum computation. This result elevates the
   formal standing of the variational approach whereas establishing a
   universal model of quantum computation.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical emulation of quantum systems often requires an exponential
   number of degrees of freedom which translates to a computational

   transitions in quantum spin chains, namely the transverse field Ising

   with no hidden layers can be effectively trained to distinguish between
   magnetically ordered and disordered phases. Our neural network acts to

Abstract = {{Solutions to many-body problem instances often involve an intractable
   number of degrees of freedom and admit no known approximations in
   general form. In practice, representing quantum-mechanical states of a
   given Hamiltonian using available numerical methods, in particular those
   based on variational Monte Carlo simulations, become exponentially more
   challenging with increasing system size. Recently quantum algorithms
   implemented as variational models have been proposed to accelerate such
   simulations. The variational ansatz states are characterized by a
   polynomial number of parameters devised in a way to minimize the
   expectation value of a given Hamiltonian, which is emulated by local
   measurements. In this study, we develop a means to certify the
   termination of variational algorithms. We demonstrate our approach by
   applying it to three models: the transverse field Ising model, the model
   of one-dimensional spinless fermions with competing interactions, and
   the Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics. By means of comparison,
   we observe that our approach shows better performance near critical
   points in these models. We hence take a further step to improve the
   applicability and to certify the results of variational quantum
   simulators.}},

Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is considered to
   be one of the most promising approaches towards using near-term quantum
   computers for practical application. In its original form, the algorithm
   applies two different Hamiltonians, called the mixer and the cost
   Hamiltonian, in alternation with the goal being to approach the ground
   state of the cost Hamiltonian. Recently, it has been suggested that one
   might use such a set-up as a parametric quantum circuit with possibly
   some other goal than reaching ground states. From this perspective, a
   recent work (Lloyd, arXiv:1812.11075) argued that for one-dimensional
   local cost Hamiltonians, composed of nearest neighbour ZZ terms, this
   set-up is quantum computationally universal and provides a universal
   gate set, i.e. all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision.
   In the present paper, we complement this work by giving a complete proof
   and the precise conditions under which such a one-dimensional QAOA might
   produce a universal gate set. We further generalize this type of
   gate-set universality for certain cost Hamiltonians with ZZ and ZZZ
   terms arranged according to the adjacency structure of certain graphs
   and hypergraphs.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed as a potentially
   viable application of quantum computers. A particular example-the
   variational quantum eigensolver, or VQE-is designed to determine a
   global minimum in an energy landscape specified by a quantum
   Hamiltonian, which makes it appealing for the needs of quantum
   chemistry. Experimental realizations have been reported in recent years
   and theoretical estimates of its efficiency are a subject of intense
   effort. Here we consider the performance of the VQE technique for a
   Hubbard-like model describing a one-dimensional chain of fermions with
   competing nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. We find that
   recovering the VQE solution allows one to obtain the correlation
   function of the ground state consistent with the exact result. We also
   study the barren plateau phenomenon for the Hamiltonian in question and
   find that the severity of this effect depends on the encoding of
   fermions to qubits. Our results are consistent with the current

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to unveil
   properties of many-body systems. Recently proposed as a tool to classify
   phases of matter, the approach relies on classical simulation
   methods-such as Monte Carlo-which are known to experience an exponential
   slowdown when simulating certain quantum systems. To overcome this
   slowdown while still leveraging machine learning, we propose a
   variational quantum algorithm which merges quantum simulation and
   quantum machine learning to classify phases of matter. Our classifier is
   directly fed labeled states recovered by the variational quantum
   eigensolver algorithm, thereby avoiding the data-reading slowdown
   experienced in many applications of quantum enhanced machine learning.
   We propose families of variational ansatz states that are inspired
   directly by tensor networks. This allows us to use tools from tensor
   network theory to explain properties of the phase diagrams the presented
   quantum algorithm recovers. Finally, we propose a majority vote quantum
   classifier built from a nearest-neighbor (checkerboard) quantum neural
   network. This classifier is successfully trained to recognize phases of
   matter with 99\% accuracy for the transverse field Ising model and 94\%
   accuracy for the XXZ model. These findings suggest that a merger between
   quantum simulation and quantum enhanced machine learning offers a
   fertile ground to develop computational insights into quantum systems.}},

Abstract = {{The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has rapidly become
   a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithm development. Despite a
   growing range of applications, only a few results have been developed
   towards understanding the algorithm's ultimate limitations. Here we
   report that QAOA exhibits a strong dependence on a problem instances
   constraint to variable ratio-this problem density places a limiting
   restriction on the algorithms capacity to minimize a corresponding
   objective function (and hence solve optimization problem instances).
   Such reachability deficits persist even in the absence of barren
   plateaus and are outside of the recently reported level-1 QAOA
   limitations. These findings are among the first to determine strong
   limitations on variational quantum approximate optimization.}},

Title = {{Experimental neural network enhanced quantum tomography}},
Journal = {{NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Quantum tomography is currently ubiquitous for testing any
   implementation of a quantum information processing device. Various
   sophisticated procedures for state and process reconstruction from
   measured data are well developed and benefit from precise knowledge of
   the model describing state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) apparatus.
   However, physical models suffer from intrinsic limitations as actual
   measurement operators and trial states cannot be known precisely. This
   scenario inevitably leads to SPAM errors degrading reconstruction
   performance. Here we develop a framework based on machine learning which
   generally applies to both the tomography and SPAM mitigation problem. We
   experimentally implement our method. We trained a supervised neural
   network to filter the experimental data and hence uncovered salient
   patterns that characterize the measurement probabilities for the
   original state and the ideal experimental apparatus free from SPAM
   errors. We compared the neural network state reconstruction protocol
   with a protocol treating SPAM errors by process tomography, as well as
   to an SPAM-agnostic protocol with idealized measurements. The average
   reconstruction fidelity is shown to be enhanced by 10\% and 27\%,
   respectively. The presented methods apply to the vast range of quantum
   experiments which rely on tomography.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{A contemporary technological milestone is to build a quantum device
   performing a computational task beyond the capability of any classical
   computer, an achievement known as quantum adversarial advantage. In what
   ways can the entanglement realized in such a demonstration be
   quantified? Inspired by the area law of tensor networks, we derive an
   upper bound for the minimum random circuit depth needed to generate the
   maximal bipartite entanglement correlations between all problem
   variables (qubits). This bound is lattice geometry dependent and makes
   explicit a nuance implicit in other proposals with physical consequence.
   The hardware itself should be able to support superlogarithmic ebits of
   entanglement across some poly(n) number of qubit bipartitions; otherwise
   the quantum state itself will not possess volumetric entanglement
   scaling and full-lattice-range correlations. Hence, as we present a
   connection between quantum advantage protocols and quantum entanglement,
   the entanglement implicitly generated by such protocols can be tested
   separately to further ascertain the validity of any quantum advantage
   claim.}},

   quantum information has resulted in a beneficial cross-over. Complex
   network methods have successfully been applied to transport and

   Novel quantum induced effects have been predicted in random graphs-where
   edges represent entangled links-and quantum computer algorithms have
   been proposed to offer enhancement for several network problems. Here we
   review the results at the cutting edge, pinpointing the similarities and
   the differences found at the intersection of these two fields.}},

Title = {{Variational learning of Grover's quantum search algorithm}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Given a parametrized quantum circuit such that a certain setting of
   these real-valued parameters corresponds to Grover's celebrated search
   algorithm, can a variational algorithm recover these settings and hence
   learn Grover's algorithm? We studied several constrained variations of
   this problem and answered this question in the affirmative, with some
   caveats. Grover's quantum search algorithm is optimal up to a constant.
   The success probability of Grover's algorithm goes from unity for two
   qubits, decreases for three and four qubits, and returns near unity for
   five qubits, then oscillates ever so close to unity, reaching unity in
   the infinite qubit limit. The variationally approach employed here found
   an experimentally discernible improvement of 5.77\% and 3.95\% for three
   and four qubits, respectively. Our findings are interesting as an
   extreme example of variational search, and they illustrate the promise
   of using hybrid quantum classical approaches to improve quantum
   algorithms. This paper further demonstrates that to find optimal
   parameters, one does not need to vary over a family of quantum circuits
   to find an optimal solution. This result looks promising and points out
   that there is a set of variational quantum problems with parameters that
   can be efficiently found on a classical computer for an arbitrary number
   of qubits.}},

Abstract = {{Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine
   learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in
   data. Quantum systems produce atypical patterns that classical systems
   are thought not to produce efficiently, so it is reasonable to postulate
   that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine
   learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to
   devise and implement quantum software that could enable machine learning
   that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent work has
   produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of
   machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are
   still considerable.}},
