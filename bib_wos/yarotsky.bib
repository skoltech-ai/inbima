Title = {{Universal Approximations of Invariant Maps by Neural Networks}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTIVE APPROXIMATION}},
Abstract = {{We describe generalizations of the universal approximation theorem for
   neural networks to maps invariant or equivariant with respect to linear
   representations of groups. Our goal is to establish network-like
   computational models that are both invariant/equivariant and provably
   complete in the sense of their ability to approximate any continuous
   invariant/equivariant map. Our contribution is three-fold. First, in the
   general case of compact groups we propose a construction of a complete
   invariant/equivariant network using an intermediate polynomial layer. We
   invoke classical theorems of Hilbert and Weyl to justify and simplify
   this construction; in particular, we describe an explicit complete
   ansatz for approximation of permutation-invariant maps. Second, we
   consider groups of translations and prove several versions of the
   universal approximation theorem for convolutional networks in the limit
   of continuous signals on euclidean spaces. Finally, we consider 2D
   signal transformations equivariant with respect to the group SE(2) of
   rigid euclidean motions. In this case we introduce the
   ``charge-conserving convnet{''}-a convnet-like computational model based
   on the decomposition of the feature space into isotypic representations
   of SO(2). We prove this model to be a universal approximator for
   continuous SE(2)-equivariant signal transformations.}},

   substantial PAPR reduction is achieved when the noise after PAPR

   approach requires time-consuming manual tuning of hyperparameters for

Abstract = {{High-throughput sequencing of fetal DNA is a promising and increasingly
   common method for the discovery of all (or all coding) genetic variants
   in the fetus, either as part of prenatal screening or diagnosis, or for
   genetic diagnosis of spontaneous abortions. In many cases, the fetal DNA
   (from chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, or abortive tissue) can be
   contaminated with maternal cells, resulting in the mixture of fetal and
   maternal DNA. This maternal cell contamination (MCC) undermines the
   assumption, made by traditional variant callers, that each allele in a
   heterozygous site is covered, on average, by 50\% of the reads, and
   therefore can lead to erroneous genotype calls. We present a panel of
   methods for reducing the genotyping error in the presence of MCC. All
   methods start with the output of GATK HaplotypeCaller on the sequencing
   data for the (contaminated) fetal sample and both of its parents, and
   additionally rely on information about the MCC fraction (which itself is
   readily estimated from the high-throughput sequencing data). The first
   of these methods uses a Bayesian probabilistic model to correct the
   fetal genotype calls produced by MCC-unaware HaplotypeCaller. The other
   two methods ``learn{''} the genotype-correction model from examples. We
   use simulated contaminated fetal data to train and test the models.
   Using the test sets, we show that all three methods lead to
   substantially improved accuracy when compared with the original
   MCC-unaware HaplotypeCaller calls. We then apply the best-performing
   method to three chorionic villus samples from spontaneously terminated
   pregnancies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new candidates list re-calculating to
   improve performance of iterative nonlinear detection and decoding in
   Multi-User (MU) Massive Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) system.
   The proposed nonlinear iterative detector includes a new algorithm of
   users (UEs) sorting before QR decomposition (QRD) and a new
   sorting-reduced (SR) K-best method. If MIMO detector is based on a
   candidates list updates, the performance can be improved by the
   candidates list re-calculating or using a priori information in the list
   generation. This is natural, because the quality of the candidates list
   is likely to be improved by using the decoder output as a priori
   information. We analyze the convergence of combining the detection
   algorithms with the soft low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we proposed a discrete sorting optimization approach for
   uplink channel of Massive Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) system.
   The algorithm includes users (UEs) sorting before QR decomposition (QRD)
   and sorting reduced (SR) K-best detector for 48x64 MIMO uncoded systems.
   Simulation results show that detector losses is about 1dB to a Maximum
   Likelihood (ML) detection in low detector complexity.
   The UEs sorting is required to sort diagonal elements of the R matrix in
   ascending order to avoid error propagation in multiuser (MU) scenario.
   Fast and low complexity method of online discrete optimization is used
   to find the loss function minimum. Sorting tracking is proposed, so that
   the pre-sorted interpolated R matrix is used for further sorting
   optimization, resulting in low sorting complexity. The proposed sorting
   demonstrates huge performance gain compare to a common power-based one.
   Simulation results in SG QuaDRiGa channel are presented.
   SR-K-best detector is a variant of K-best detector. The SR K -best with
   (K,S,p) parameters results in significant losses in scenarios with high
   correlated users, therefore we proposed a new structure (K,S,p,v,q) of
   the SR-K-best algorithm and a new discrete optimization method to
   increase performance. Discrete stochastic optimization was done offline
   in QuaDRiGa channel to find optimal (K,S,p,v,q) parameters for fixed
   detector structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new unused beam reservation (UBR) algorithm is proposed
   to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (OFDM) signal in the downlink channel of Massive
   Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system. The main challenge with
   PAPR reduction in coming 5G system is the selection of a method, which
   has an ultra-low latency and ability to reduce PAPR without performance
   degradation of high order modulation users (QAM256, QAM1024). This paper
   reviews some conventional PAPR reduction techniques with respect to
   selective tone reservation algorithm (STR, {[}1]) and finally we propose
   the UBR algorithm, which provides an extra gain in multi-user (MU) MIMO
   application scenarios.
   UBR is a non-iterative algorithm compared with a well-known tones
   reservation, constellation extension and clipping \& filtering methods.
   It is based on a non-iterative modulation of unused beams amplitudes in
   the downlink channel of MU-MIMO so that target users are not degraded
   while PAPR is reduced on each TX antenna. Also UBR is fully consistent
   with 5G standard requirements and has a low latency. Advantages and
   disadvantages of this technique are discussed in details, simulation
   results are presented for 64 antennas of virtual Massive MIMO cell.}},

Abstract = {{Modern railway networks include thousands of failure registration
   devices, and prompt response to detected failures is critical to normal
   network operation. However, a large share of produced alerts may be
   formed by false alarms associated with maintenance or faulty
   diagnostics, thus hindering the processing of actual failures. It is
   therefore very desirable to perform fast automated intelligent ranking
   of incidents before they are analyzed by human operators. In this paper
   we describe a machine-learning-based incident ranking model that we have
   developed and deployed at the Moscow Railway network (a large network
   with 500+ stations). The model estimates the probability of failure
   using multiple features of the incident at hand. The model was
   constructed using the XGBoost library and a database of 5 million
   historical incidents. The model shows high accuracy (AUC 0.901) in the
   deployment environment.}},
