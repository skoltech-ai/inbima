Title = {{Detecting cooking state of grilled chicken by electronic nose and

Abstract = {{Determination of food doneness remains a challenge for automation in the
   cooking industry. The complex physicochemical processes that occur
   during cooking require a combination of several methods for their
   control. Herein, we utilized an electronic nose and computer vision to
   check the cooking state of grilled chicken. Thermogravimetry,
   differential mobility analysis, and mass spectrometry were employed to
   deepen the fundamental insights towards the grilling process. The
   results indicated that an electronic nose could distinguish the odor
   profile of the grilled chicken, whereas computer vision could identify
   discoloration of the chicken. The integration of these two methods
   yields greater selectivity towards the qualitative determination of
   chicken doneness. The odor profile is matched with detected water loss,
   and the release of aromatic and sulfur-containing compounds during
   cooking. This work demonstrates the practicability of the developed
   technique, which we compared with a sensory evaluation, for better
   deconvolution of food state during cooking.}},

Abstract = {{The localization and trajectory estimation of mobile robots is one of
   the fundamental problems in contemporary robotics. To solve it, robots
   often rely on the laser scanner data, which is being processed by
   scan-matcher algorithms followed by a simple integration of acquired
   transformations. Here we propose algorithm to improve the accuracy of
   trajectory estimation using additional correspondences between scans and
   the idea that all transformations between pairs of not too far away{''}
   scans should be consistent between themselves. Additionally, weighting
   based on the scan-matcher error estimation allows us to reduce the
   importance of scan-matcher results, which can not be reliably matched.
   Our approach can be used to improve the performance of existing
   simultaneous localization and mapping setups in the form of an easily
   pluggable middleware, which depends only on the laser scanner and
   odometry data. Experimental evaluation on MIT Stata Center dataset shows
   that our method outperforms standard keyframe approach by more than 20\%
   by root mean square error metric. In an experiment performed at the
   Skoltech using different setup our method showed almost 35\%
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Topological optimization finds a material density distribution
   minimizing a functional of the solution of a partial differential
   equation (PDE), subject to a set of constraints (typically, a bound on
   the volume or mass of the material).
   Using a finite elements discretization (FEM) of the PDE and functional
   we obtain an integer programming problem. Due to approximation error of
   the FEM discretization, optimization problem becomes mesh-depended and
   possess false, physically inadequate optimums, while functional value
   heavily depends on the fineness of discretization scheme used to compute
   it. To alleviate this problem, we propose regularization of given
   functional by error estimate of the FEM discretization. This
   regularization provides robustness of solutions and improves obtained
   functional values as well.
   While the idea is broadly applicable, in this paper we apply our method
   to the heat conduction optimization. Problems of this type are of
   practical importance in design of heat conduction channels, heat sinks
   and other types of heat guides.}},

Abstract = {{An information dissemination campaign is often multifaceted, involving
   several facets or pieces of information disseminating from different
   sources. The question then arises, how should we assign such pieces to
   eligible sources so as to achieve the best viral dissemination results?
   Past research has studied the problem of Influence Maximization (IM),
   which is to select a set of k promoters that maximizes the expected
   reach of a message over a network. However, in this classical IM
   problem, each promoter spreads out the same unitary piece of
   information.
   In this paper, we propose the Optimal Influential Pieces Assignment
   (0171),A) problem, which is to assign k distinct pieces of an
   information campaign T to k promoters, so as to achieve the highest
   viral adoption in a network. We express adoption by users with a
   logistic model, and show that approximating OIPA within any constant
   factor is NP-hard. Even so, we propose a branch and-hound framework for
   OIPA with an (1 - 1/e) approximation ratio. We further optimize this
   framework with a pruning intensive progressive upper-bound estimation
   approach, yielding a (1 - 1/e - epsilon) approximation ratio and
   significantly lower time complexity, as it relies on the power-law
   properties of real-world social networks to run efficiently. Our
   extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that the
   proposed approaches consistently outperform intuitive baselines, adopted
   from state-of-the-art IM algorithms. Furthermore, the progressive
   approach demonstrates superior efficiency with an up to 24-fold speedup
   over the plain branch-and-bound approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study an instance of the G-closure problem for
   two-dimensional periodic metamaterials. Specifically, we consider
   composites with isotropic homogenized elasticity tensor, obtained as a
   mixture of two isotropic materials. We focus on the case when one
   material has zero stiffness, i.e., single-material structures with
   voids. This problem is important, in particular, in the context of
   designing small-scale structures for metamaterials that can be
   manufactured using additive fabrication. A range of effective
   metamaterial properties can be obtained this way using a single base
   material.
   We demonstrate that two closely related simple parametric families based
   on the structure proposed by Sigmund in {[}26] attain good coverage of
   the space of isotropic properties satisfying Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. In
   particular, for positive Poisson's ratio, we demonstrate that
   Hashin-Shtrikman bound can be approximated arbitrarily well, within
   limits imposed by numerical approximation: a strong evidence that these
   bounds are achievable in this case. For negative Poisson's ratios, we
   numerically obtain a bound which we hypothesize to be close to optimal,
   at least for metamaterials with rotational symmetries of a regular
   triangle tiling. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an investigation of the thermal dissociation of the gas
   phase, non-covalent streptavidin tetramer ion. Using an extended
   desolvating capillary, it was observed that this complex fragments at an
   activation energy around 75 kJ/mole. The fragmentation occurs via charge
   migration and the ejection of a single monomer that carries half the
   total charge. Temperature increases result in intensive
   supermetallization by sodium ions and, eventually, in thermal
   dissociation. Using the in-ESI source H/D exchange approach, we observed
   that deuterium scrambling during the dissociation is relatively low. To
   better understand the charged droplets dynamics, we performed accurate
   computer simulations of airflow inside the desolvating capillary,
   including calculating the gas velocity, temperature and pressure
   distributions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{SimRank is a well-known similarity measure between graph vertices. This
   measure relies on a graph topology and is built on the intuition that
   `two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects'.
   Formalization of this intuition leads to a system of linear equations,
   so large that even the solution vector will not fit in the RAM for many
   real-world graphs. To solve this issue we propose a new method based on
   a low-rank approximation of the linear system solution. This approach
   requires less memory and provides a significant calculation speed-up.
   The experiments show that the proposed method provides an accurate
   SimRank approximation.}},
