Abstract = {{Spatial soil sampling is an integral part of a soil survey aimed at
   describing spatial variability in soil properties. We propose
   considering the soil sampling procedure as a task of optimal design. In
   practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce experimentation costs,
   as they allow the researcher to obtain one optimal set of points.
   We present a sampling design, based on the fundamental idea of selecting
   sample locations with the most significant dissimilarities. The proposed
   sampling design is founded upon an optimal design method called the
   maxvol algorithm. The sampling design is tested in three real cases
   differing in field data availability and compared to the popular
   sampling schemes - simple random sampling, conditional Latin Hypercube,
   Kennard-Stone and stratified random sampling based on complex
   geographical strata.
   It is shown that the maxvol-base algorithm has a high potential for
   practical usage. Our method outperforms popular sampling methods in soil
   taxa prediction based on topographical features of the site. The
   proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for practical
   application because it can produce high-quality sampling scheme with
   very few points.}},
