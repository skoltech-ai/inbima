Abstract = {{Sensor networks require a high degree of synchronization in order to
   produce a stream of data useful for further purposes. Examples of time
   misalignment manifest as undesired artifacts when doing multi-camera
   bundle-adjustment or global positioning system (GPS) geo-localization
   for mapping. Network Time Protocol (NTP) variants of clock
   synchronization can provide accurate results, though present high
   variance conditioned by the environment and the channel load. We propose
   a new precise technique for software clock synchronization over a
   network of rigidly attached devices using gyroscope data. Gyroscope
   sensors, or IMU, provide a high-rate measurements that can be processed
   efficiently. We use optimization tools over the correlation signal of
   IMU data from a network of gyroscope sensors. Our method provides stable
   microseconds accuracy, regardless of the number of sensors and the
   conditions of the network. In this paper, we show the performance of the
   gyroscope software synchronization in a controlled environment, and we
   evaluate the performance in a sensor network of smartphones by our
   open-source Android App, Twist-n-Sync, that is publicly available.}},

Title = {{Robotic-assisted surgery in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty:
   does it improve the precision of the surgery and its clinical outcomes?

Abstract = {{There is a high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis that affects only the
   medial tibiofemoral compartment. In this group of patients with severe
   disease, the medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an
   excellent choice. However, this technique has a great learning curve due
   to the lower tolerance of improper positioning and alignment. In this
   context, the robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) arises as an option to
   improve the accuracy and secondarily enhance the clinical outcomes
   related to the UKA. The objective in this study is to determine if there
   are significant advantages with the use of RAS over conventional surgery
   (CS). In the systematic review of the literature, classification of the
   results in three main subjects: (A) precision and alignment; (B)
   functional results and clinical parameters; (C) survivorship. We found
   272 studies, of which 15 meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   There is mostly described that RAS significantly improves the accuracy
   in position (80-100\% of planned versus performed P < 0.05), alignment
   (2-3 times less error variance P < 0.05) and selection of the proper
   size of the implants (69.23\% of correct size femoral implants versus
   16.67\% using CS P < 0.0154). Recently, there is mild evidence about
   benefits in the early rehabilitation and post-operative pain, but in all
   studies reviewed, there is no advantages of RAS in the long-term
   functional evaluation. There is no strong literature that supports a
   longer survival of the prothesis with RAS, being the longest mean
   follow-up reported of 29.6 months. RAS is a useful tool in increasing
   the precision of the medial UKA implant placement. However, there is
   still a lack of evidence that properly correlates this improvement in
   accuracy with better clinical, functional and survival results.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To establish recommendations for diagnosis, classification,
   treatment, and rehabilitation of posteromedial corner (PMC) knee
   injuries using a modified Delphi technique. Methods A list of statements
   concerning the diagnosis, classification, treatment and rehabilitation
   of PMC injuries was created by a working group of four individuals.
   Using a modified Delphi technique, a group of 35 surgeons with expertise
   in PMC injuries was surveyed, on three occasions, to establish consensus
   on the inclusion or exclusion of each statement. Experts were encouraged
   to propose further suggestions or modifications following each round.
   Pre-defined criteria were used to refine item lists after each survey.
   The final document included statements reaching consensus in round
   three. Results Thirty-five experts had a 100\% response rate for all
   three rounds. A total of 53 items achieved over 75\% consensus. The
   overall rate of consensus was 82.8\%. Statements pertaining to PMC
   reconstruction and those regarding the treatment of combined cruciate
   and PMC injuries reached 100\% consensus. Consensus was reached for
   85.7\% of the statements on anatomy of the PMC, 90\% for those relating
   to diagnosis, 70\% relating to classification, 64.3\% relating to the
   treatment of isolated PMC injuries, and 83.3\% relating to
   rehabilitation after PMC reconstruction. Conclusion A modified Delphi
   technique was applied to generate an expert consensus statement
   concerning the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and rehabilitation
   practices for PMC injuries of the knee with high levels of expert
   agreement. Though the majority of statements pertaining to anatomy,
   diagnosis, and rehabilitation reached consensus, there remains
   inconsistency as to the optimal approach to treating isolated PMC
   injuries. Additionally, there is a need for improved PMC injury
   classification.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop a statement on the diagnosis, classification,
   treatment, and rehabilitation concepts of posterolateral corner (PLC)
   injuries of the knee using a modified Delphi technique.MethodsA working
   group of three individuals generated a list of statements relating to
   the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and rehabilitation of PLC
   injuries to form the basis of an initial survey for rating by an
   international group of experts. The PLC expert group (composed of 27
   experts throughout the world) was surveyed on three occasions to
   establish consensus on the inclusion/exclusion of each item. In addition
   to rating agreement, experts were invited to propose further items for
   inclusion or to suggest modifications of existing items at each round.
   Pre-defined criteria were used to refine item lists after each survey.
   Statements reaching consensus in round three were included within the
   final consensus document.ResultsTwenty-seven experts (100\% response
   rate) completed three rounds of surveys. After three rounds, 29 items
   achieved consensus with over 75\% agreement and less than 5\%
   disagreement. Consensus was reached in 92\% of the statements relating
   to diagnosis of PLC injuries, 100\% relating to classification, 70\%
   relating to treatment and in 88\% of items relating to rehabilitation
   statements, with an overall consensus of 81\%.ConclusionsThis study has
   established a consensus statement relating to the diagnosis,
   classification, treatment, and rehabilitation of PLC injuries. Further
   research is needed to develop updated classification systems, and better
   understand the role of non-invasive and minimally invasive approaches
   along with standardized rehabilitation protocols.Level of

Abstract = {{This paper presents the anticipative kinodynamic planning (AKP) approach
   for robot navigation in urban environments, while satisfying both
   dynamic and nonholonomic constraints. Our main motivation is to minimize
   the impact that the robot is doing to the environment, i.e. other
   pedestrians, while successfully achieving a navigation goal. To this
   end, we require a better understanding of the environment, and thus, we
   propose to integrate seamlessly a human motion prediction algorithm into
   the planning algorithm. In addition, we are able to anticipate for each
   of the robot's calculated paths or actions the corresponding people's
   future trajectories, which is essential to reduce the impact to nearby
   pedestrians. Multi-objective cost functions are proposed and we describe
   a well-posed procedure to build joint cost functions. Plenty of
   simulations and real experiments have been carried out to demonstrate
   the success of the AKP, compared to other navigation approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the Eigen-Factor (EF) method, which
   estimates a planar surface from a set of point clouds (PCs), with the
   peculiarity that these points have been observed from different poses,
   i.e. the trajectory described by a sensor. We propose to use multiple
   Eigen-Factors (EFs) or different planes' estimations, that allow to
   solve the multiframe alignment over a sequence of observed PCs.
   Moreover, the complexity of the EFs optimization is independent of the
   number of points, but depends on the number of planes and poses. To
   achieve this, a closed-form of the gradient is derived by
   differentiating over the minimum eigenvalue with respect to poses, hence
   the name Eigen-Factor. In addition, a time-continuous trajectory version
   of EFs is proposed. The EFs approach is evaluated on a simulated
   environment and compared with two variants of ICP, showing that it is
   possible to optimize over all point errors, improving both the accuracy
   and computational time. Code has been made publicly available.}},

Title = {{No association between positive intraoperative allograft cultures and
   infection rates after reconstructive knee ligament surgery}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several reports of severe infections associated with
   allograft tissue in knee reconstructive surgery have led many surgeons
   to consider routine intraoperative culture of allograft tissue before
   implantation. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the
   prevalence of positive soft tissue allograft cultures in reconstructive
   knee surgery, and evaluate its association with surgical site infection.
   Methods: Retrospective study of 202 patients who underwent knee
   reconstructive ligament surgeries, including revisions, between January
   2013 and July 2017. Intraoperative culture results were obtained and the
   report of a surgical site infection during follow-up was recorded.
   Patients without cultures were excluded. A priori power analysis was
   performed. The association between positive culture results and
   development of surgical site infection was evaluated using Fisher's
   Exact test (P < 0.05).
   Results: A total of 300 allografts were implanted in 202 patients. Mean
   average follow-up was 32.9 +/- 12.5 (range 13 to 57.9) months. Sixteen
   patients had positive intraoperative allograft cultures (7.9\%). The
   most frequently isolated organism was Bacillus species (six cultures);
   none of these patients presented with clinical signs of infection. Nine
   patients developed surgical site infections and were treated with oral
   antibiotics, and one patient developed septic arthritis that required
   surgical debridement of the implanted graft; all of these patients had a
   negative soft tissue allograft culture. No significant association was
   found between a positive culture and surgical site infection (P = 0.43).
   Conclusion: There was no apparent association between positive
   intraoperative irradiated soft tissue allograft cultures and surgical
   site infection in reconstructive knee surgery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Scaling up robot swarms to collectives of hundreds or even thousands
   without sacrificing sensing, processing, and locomotion capabilities is
   a challenging problem. Low-cost robots are potentially scalable, but the
   majority of existing systems have limited capabilities, and these
   limitations substantially constrain the type of experiments that could
   be performed by robotics researchers. Instead of adding functionality by
   adding more components and therefore increasing the cost, we demonstrate
   how low-cost hardware can be used beyond its standard functionality. We
   systematically review 15 swarm robotic systems and analyse their sensing
   capabilities by applying a general sensor model from the sensing and
   measurement community. This work is based on the HoverBot system. A
   HoverBot is a levitating circuit board that manoeuvres by pulling itself
   towards magnetic anchors that are embedded into the robot arena. We show
   that HoverBot's magnetic field readouts from its Hall-effect sensor can
   be associated to successful movement, robot rotation and collision
   measurands. We build a time series classifier based on these magnetic
   field readouts. We modify and apply signal processing techniques to
   enable the online classification of the time-variant magnetic field
   measurements on HoverBot's low-cost microcontroller. We enabled HoverBot
   with successful movement, rotation, and collision sensing capabilities
   by utilising its single Hall-effect sensor. We discuss how our
   classification method could be applied to other sensors to increase a
   robot's functionality while retaining its cost.}},

Abstract = {{In Multi-Policy Decision-Making (MPDM), many computationally-expensive
   forward simulations are performed in order to predict the performance of
   a set of candidate policies. In risk-aware formulations of MPDM, only
   the worst outcomes affect the decision making process, and efficiently
   finding these influential outcomes becomes the core challenge. Recently,
   stochastic gradient optimization algorithms, using a heuristic function,
   were shown to be significantly superior to random sampling.
   In this paper, we show that accurate gradients can be computed - even
   through a complex forward simulation - using approaches similar to those
   in deep networks. We show that our proposed approach finds influential
   outcomes more reliably, and is faster than earlier methods, allowing us
   to evaluate more policies while simultaneously eliminating the need to
   design an easily-differentiable heuristic function. We demonstrate
   significant performance improvements in simulation as well as on a real
   robot platform navigating a highly dynamic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-aware Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) is a powerful framework
   for reliable navigation in a dynamic social environment where rather
   than evaluating individual trajectories, a ``library{''} of policies
   (reactive controllers) is evaluated by anticipating potentially
   dangerous future outcomes using an on-line forward roll-out process.
   There is a core tension in Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) systems -
   it is desirable to add more policies to the system for flexibility in
   finding good policies, however, this increases computational cost. As a
   result, MPDM was limited to small (perhaps 5-10) discrete policies - a
   significant performance bottleneck.
   In this paper, we radically enhance the expressivity of MPDM by allowing
   policies to have continuous-valued parameters, while simultaneously
   satisfying real-time constraints by quickly discovering promising policy
   parameters through a novel iterative gradient-based algorithm. Our
   evaluation includes results from extensive simulation and real-world
   experiments in semi-crowded environments.}},

Abstract = {{For online robots, incremental SLAM algorithms offer huge potential
   computational savings over batch algorithms. The dominant incremental
   algorithms are iSAM and iSAM2 which offer radically different approaches
   to computing incremental updates, balancing issues like 1) the need to
   relinearize, 2) changes in the desirable variable marginalization order,
   and 3) the underlying conceptual approach (i.e. the ``matrix{''} story
   versus the ``factor graph{''} story).
   In this paper, we propose a new incremental algorithm that computes
   solutions with lower absolute error and generally provides lower error
   solutions for a fixed computational budget than either iSAM or iSAM2.
   Key to AprilSAM's performance are a new dynamic variable reordering
   algorithm for fast incremental Cholesky factorizations, a method for
   reducing the work involved in backsubstitutions, and a new algorithm for
   deciding between incremental and batch updates.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling up robot swarms to collectives of hundreds or even thousands
   without sacrificing sensing, processing, and locomotion capabilities is
   a challenging problem. Low-cost robots are potentially scalable, but the
   majority of existing systems have limited capabilities, and these
   limitations substantially constrain the type of experiments that could
   be performed by robotics researchers. As an alternative to increasing
   the quantity of robots by reducing their functionality, we have
   developed a new technology that delivers increased functionality at
   low-cost. In this study, we present a comprehensive literature review on
   the most commonly used locomotion strategies of swarm robotic systems.
   We introduce a new type of low-friction locomotion-active low-friction
   locomotion-and we show its first implementation in the HoverBot system.
   The HoverBot system consists of an air levitation and magnet table, and
   a HoverBot agent. HoverBot agents are levitating circuit boards that we
   have equipped with an array of planar coils and a Hall-effect sensor.
   The HoverBot agent uses its coils to pull itself toward magnetic anchors
   that are embedded into a levitation table. These robots use active
   low-friction locomotion; consist of only surface-mount components;
   circumvent actuator calibration; are capable of odometry by using a
   single Hall-effect sensor; and perform precise movement. We conducted
   three hours of experimental evaluation of the HoverBot system in which
   we observed the system performing more than 10,000 steps. We also
   demonstrate formation movement, random collision, and straight
   collisions with two robots. This study demonstrates that active
   low-friction locomotion is an alternative to wheeled and slip-stick
   locomotion in the field of swarm robotics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel robot social-aware navigation framework to walk
   side-by-side with people in crowded urban areas in a safety and natural
   way. The new system includes the following key issues: to propose a new
   robot social-aware navigation model to accompany a person; to extend the
   Social Force Model, ``Extended Social-Force Model{''}, to consider the
   person and robot's interactions; to use a human predictor to estimate
   the destination of the person the robot is walking with; and to
   interactively learning the parameters of the social-aware navigation
   model using multimodal human feedback. Finally, a quantitative metric
   based on people's personal spaces and comfortableness criteria, is
   introduced in order to evaluate quantitatively the performance of the
   robot's task. The validation of the model is accomplished throughout an
   extensive set of simulations and real-life experiments. In addition, a
   volunteers' survey is used to measure the acceptability of our robot
   companion's behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive side-by-side human-robot companion
   approach for navigation in urban dynamic environments, based on the
   anticipative kinodynamic planning. The adaptive means that the robot is
   capable of adjusting its motion to the behavior of the person being
   accompanied. Our main objective is to optimize in real time the path
   performed by the pair human-robot, by modifying dynamically the angle
   and distance between both throughout different locations of the path. We
   have defined a new cost function for finding the best planned path that
   takes into account the cost of the geometrical configuration between the
   human and the robot. Moreover, we have modified the Extended Social
   Force Model (SFM) to include the required forces to maintain the angle
   and distance between the robot and human while the human-robot pair is
   moving towards the shared goal. The method has been validated throughout
   a large set of simulations and real-live experiments.}},
