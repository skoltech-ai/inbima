Abstract = {{Feature selection is a crucial step in data processing and machine
   learning. While many greedy and sequential feature selection approaches
   are available, a holistic neurodynamics approach to supervised feature
   selection is recently developed via fractional programming by minimizing
   feature redundancy and maximizing relevance simultaneously. In view that
   the gradient of the fractional objective function is also fractional,
   alternative problem formulations are desirable to obviate the fractional
   complexity. In this paper, the fractional programming problem
   formulation is equivalently reformulated as bilevel and bilinear
   programming problems without using any fractional function. Two
   two-timescale projection neural networks are adapted for solving the
   reformulated problems. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets
   are elaborated to demonstrate the global convergence and high
   classification performance of the proposed neurodynamic approaches in
   comparison with six mainstream feature selection approaches. (C) 2021

Abstract = {{This paper presents new theoretical results on the multi-periodicity of
   recurrent neural networks with time delays evoked by periodic inputs
   under stochastic disturbances and state-dependent switching. Based on
   the geometric properties of activation function and switching threshold,
   the neuronal state space is partitioned into 5(n) regions in which 3(n)
   ones are shown to be positively invariant with probability one.
   Furthermore, by using Ito's formula, Lyapunov functional method, and the
   contraction mapping theorem, two criteria are proposed to ascertain the
   existence and mean-square exponential stability of a periodic orbit in
   every positive invariant set. As a result, the number of mean-square
   exponentially stable periodic orbits increases to 3(n) from 2(n) in a
   neural network without switching. Two illustrative examples are
   elaborated to substantiate the efficacy and characteristics of the
   theoretical results. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the event-triggered dynamic surface control of an
   underactuated autonomous surface vehicle with unknown kinetics for
   circumnavigating a dynamic target with unknown velocity. A modular
   design approach to the event-triggered dynamic surface control is
   proposed for target enclosing. In the estimator module, an extended
   state observer is employed for estimating the relative motion between
   the target and the surface vehicle. A fuzzy system is used for online
   modeling the unknown vehicle kinetics. In the controller module, an
   event-triggered dynamic surface control law is constructed by using the
   estimated relative velocities and vehicle kinetics in the estimator
   module. In the control law, a triggered mechanism is introduced to
   reduce the transmission load and the execution rate of actuators.
   Besides, the control inputs are bounded with the aid of a projection
   operator and saturated functions. The input-to-state stability of the
   closed-loop target enclosing system is proven through Lyapunov analysis.
   Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the event-triggered
   dynamic surface control method for circumnavigating a maneuvering

Abstract = {{Feature selection is an important issue in machine learning and data
   mining. Most existing feature selection methods are greedy in nature
   thus are prone to sub-optimality. Though some global feature selection
   methods based on unsupervised redundancy minimization can potentiate
   clustering performance improvements, their efficacy for classification
   may be limited. In this paper, a neurodynamics-based holistic feature
   selection approach is proposed via feature redundancy minimization and
   relevance maximization. An information-theoretic similarity coefficient
   matrix is defined based on multi-information and entropy to measure
   feature redundancy with respect to class labels. Supervised feature
   selection is formulated as a fractional programming problem based on the
   similarity coefficients. A neurodynamic approach based on two one-layer
   recurrent neural networks is developed for solving the formulated
   feature selection problem. Experimental results with eight benchmark
   datasets are discussed to demonstrate the global convergence of the
   neural networks and superiority of the proposed neurodynamic approach to
   several existing feature selection methods in terms of classification
   accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are marine vessels capable of
   performing various marine operations without a crew in a variety of
   cluttered and hostile water/ocean environments. For complex missions,
   there are increasing needs for deploying a fleet of ASVs instead of a
   single one to complete difficult tasks. Cooperative operations with a
   fleet of ASVs offer great advantages with enhanced capability and
   efficacy. Despite various application potentials, coordinated motion
   control of ASVs pose great challenges due to the multiplicity of ASVs,
   complexity of intravehicle interactions and fleet formation with
   collision avoidance requirements, and scarcity of communication
   bandwidths in sea environments. Coordinated control of multiple ASVs has
   received considerable attention in the last decade. This article
   provides an overview of recent advances in coordinated control of
   multiple ASVs. First, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion
   control of ASVs are presented. Next, coordinated control architecture
   and methods of multiple ASVs are briefly discussed. Then, recent results
   on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control
   of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Finally, several theoretical
   and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations
   including network-based coordination, event-triggered coordination,
   collision-free coordination, optimization-based coordination,
   data-driven coordination of ASVs, and task-region-oriented coordination
   of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a two-timescale duplex neurodynamic approach to

   reformulation with additional bilinear equality or inequality

   optimization is used to update the initial neuronal states iteratively
   to escape from local minima toward better initial states. In spite of
   its minimal system complexity, the approach is proven to be almost
   surely convergent to optimal solutions. Its superior performance is
   substantiated via solving five benchmark problems.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) empower the integration of physical
   processes and cyber infrastructure with the aid of ubiquitous
   computation resources and communication capabilities. CPSs have
   permeated modern society and found extensive applications in a wide
   variety of areas, including energy, transportation, advanced
   manufacturing, and medical health. The security of CPSs against
   cyberattacks has been regarded as a long-standing concern. However, CPSs
   suffer from extendable vulnerabilities that are beyond classical
   networked systems due to the tight integration of cyber and physical
   components. Sophisticated and malicious cyberattacks continue to emerge
   to adversely impact CPS operation, resulting in performance degradation,
   service interruption, and system failure. Secure state estimation and
   control technologies play a vital role in warranting reliable monitoring
   and operation of safety-critical CPSs. This article provides a review of
   the state-of-the-art results for secure state estimation and control of
   CPSs. Specifically, the latest development of secure state estimation is
   summarized in light of different performance indicators and defense
   strategies. Then, the recent results on secure control are discussed and
   classified into three categories: 1) centralized secure control; 2)
   distributed secure control; and 3) resource-aware secure control.
   Furthermore, two specific application examples of water supply
   distribution systems and wide-area power systems are presented to
   demonstrate the applicability of secure state estimation and control
   approaches. Finally, several challenging issues are discussed to direct
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents new theoretical results on global exponential

   a state-dependent memristive neural network model is introduced in terms

   impulsive pinning control. A salient feature of these two pinning
   control schemes is that only partial information on the neighbors of
   pinned nodes is needed. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem and
   Divergence theorem, sufficient criteria are derived to ascertain the
   global exponential synchronization of coupled neural networks via the
   two pining control schemes. Finally, two illustrative examples are
   elaborated to substantiate the theoretical results and demonstrate the

Abstract = {{This paper presents new theoretical results on the multistability of
   switched recurrent neural networks with radial basis functions and
   state-dependent switching. By partitioning state space, applying Brouwer
   fixed-point theorem and constructing a Lyapunov function, the number of
   the equilibria and their locations are estimated and their
   stability/instability are analyzed under some reasonable assumptions on
   the decomposition of index set and switching threshold. It is shown that
   the switching threshold plays an important role in increasing the number
   of stable equilibria and different multistability results can be
   obtained under different ranges of switching threshold. The results
   suggest that switched recurrent neural networks would be superior to
   conventional ones in terms of increased storage capacity when used as
   associative memories. Two examples are discussed in detail to
   substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Sparsity is a desirable property in many nonnegative matrix
   factorization (NMF) applications. Although some level of sparseness of
   NMF solutions can be achieved by using regularization, the resulting
   sparsity depends highly on the regularization parameter to be valued in
   an ad hoc way. In this letter we formulate sparse NMF as a mixed-integer
   optimization problem with sparsity as binary constraints. A
   discrete-time projection neural network is developed for solving the
   formulated problem. Sufficient conditions for its stability and
   convergence are analytically characterized by using Lyapunov's method.
   Experimental results on sparse feature extraction are discussed to
   substantiate the superiority of this approach to extracting highly
   sparse features.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports show that projection neural networks with a
   low-dimensional state space can enhance computation speed obviously.
   This paper proposes two projection neural networks with reduced model
   dimension and complexity (RDPNNs) for solving nonlinear programming (NP)
   problems. Compared with existing projection neural networks for solving
   NP, the proposed two RDPNNs have a low-dimensional state space and low
   model complexity. Under the condition that the Hessian matrix of the
   associated Lagrangian function is positive semi-definite and positive
   definite at each Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point, the proposed two RDPNNs are
   proven to be globally stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converge
   globally to a point satisfying the reduced optimality condition of NP.
   Therefore, the proposed two RDPNNs are theoretically guaranteed to solve
   convex NP problems and a class of nonconvex NP problems. Computed
   results show that the proposed two RDPNNs have a faster computation
   speed than the existing projection neural networks for solving NP
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents theoretical results on the multistability of

   with such an activation function is difficult because state-space

   existence and stability of multiple equilibria. It is shown that the
   number of stable equilibria of an n-neuron switched neural networks is
   up to 3(n) under given conditions. In contrast to existing
   multistability results with piecewise-linear activation functions, the
   results herein are also applicable to the equilibria at switching

Abstract = {{Collaborative neurodynamic optimization (CNO) is a global search
   technique that integrates the neurodynamic optimization with a swarm
   intelligence algorithm. Diversity is a key point for global
   optimization. Mutation operator is employed in CNO to ensure diversity.
   In the existing literature, the diversification performance of different
   imitation operators is unknown. In this paper, four mutation operators,
   Gaussian, Cauchy, Ley and wavelet. mutations, are analyzed to compare
   the performances of mutation operators. Simulation results on four

Abstract = {{Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) attracts much attention
   in the past two decades because its sparse and part-based
   representations are desirable in many machine learning applications. Due
   to the combinatorial nature of the sparsity constraint in form of
   l(0)-norm, the problem is hard to solve. In this paper, a hyperbolic
   tangent function is introduced to approximate the l(0)-norm. A
   discrete-time neurodynamic approach is developed for solving the
   proposed formulation. The stability and the convergence behavior are
   shown for the state vectors. Experiment results are discussed to
   demonstrate the superiority of the approach. The results show that this
   approach outperforms other sparse NMF approaches with the smallest
   relative reconstruction error and the required level of sparsity.}},

Abstract = {{L-0-constrained optimization problem has been widely applied to sparse
   signal reconstruction (e.g., basis pursuit denoising and compressed
   sensing) in signal processing, statistics, and related fields. However,
   it is an NP-hard problem to obtain the optimal solution of the
   L-0-constrained optimization problem in the recovery of compressive
   sensed signals. In this paper, we apply neurodynamic approach to solve
   the L-0-constrained optimization problem. Based on an inverted Gaussian
   function, a function of L-0 approximation can be obtained and a
   three-layer projection-type neurodynamic model is further constructed.
   The L-0 approximation constraint condition and a convexity objective
   function under which the neurodynamic optimization method is guaranteed
   to achieve the locally convergent optimal solution. Experimental results
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed neurodynamic approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a design method is presented for path-following control
   of under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles subject to velocity and
   input constraints, as well as internal and external disturbances. In the
   guidance loop, a kinematic control law of the desired surge speed and
   pitch rate is derived based on a backstepping technique and a
   line-of-sight guidance principle. In the control loop, an extended state
   observer is developed to estimate the extended state composed of unknown
   internal dynamics and external disturbances. Then, a disturbance
   rejection control law is constructed using the extended state observer.
   To bridge the guidance loop and the control loop, a reference governor
   is proposed for computing optimal guidance signals within the velocity
   and input constraints. The reference governor is formulated as a
   quadratically constrained optimization problem. A projection neural
   network is employed for solving the optimization problem in real time.
   Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
   for path-following control of autonomous underwater vehicles subject to
   constraints and disturbances simultaneously in the vertical plane.}},

   constrained biconvex optimization. The two-timescale duplex neurodynamic
   system consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) operating

   are able to avoid instability. In addition, based on the convergent
   states of the two RNNs, particle swarm optimization is used to optimize
   initial states of the RNNs to avoid local minima. It is proven that the
   proposed system is globally convergent to the global optimum with
   probability one. The performance of the twotimescale duplex neurodynamic
   system is substantiated based on the benchmark problems. Furthermore,
   the proposed system is applied for L-1-constrained nonnegative matrix

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the multistability of switched neural
   networks with piecewise linear activation functions under
   state-dependent switching. Under some reasonable assumptions on the
   switching threshold and activation functions, by using the state-space
   decomposition method, contraction mapping theorem, and strictly
   diagonally dominant matrix theory, we can characterize the number of
   equilibria as well as analyze the stability/instability of the
   equilibria. More interesting, we can find that the switching threshold
   plays an important role for stable equilibria in the unsaturation
   regions of activation functions, and the number of stable equilibria of
   an n-neuron switched neural network with state-dependent parameters
   increases to 3(n) from 2(n) in the conventional one. Furthermore, for
   two-neuron switched neural networks, the precise attraction basin of
   each stable equilibrium point can be figured out, and its boundary is
   composed of the stable manifolds of unstable equilibrium points and the
   switching lines. Two simulation examples are discussed in detail to
   substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a collaborative neurodynamic optimization approach is
   proposed for global and combinatorial optimization. First, a
   combinatorial optimization problem is reformulated as a global
   optimization problem. Second, a neurodynamic optimization model based on
   an augmented Lagrangian function is proposed and its states are proven
   to be asymptotically stable at a strict local minimum in the presence of
   nonconvexity in objective function or constraints. In addition, multiple
   neurodynamic optimization models are employed to search for global
   optimal solutions collaboratively and particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   is used to optimize their initial states. The proposed approach is shown
   to be globally convergent to global optimal solutions as substantiated
   for solving benchmark problems. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method is presented for antidisturbance constrained
   control of autonomous underwater vehicles subject to uncertainties and
   constraints. The uncertainties stem from uncertain hydrodynamic
   parameters, modeling errors, and unknown forces due to the ocean
   currents in an underwater environment. An antidisturbance constrained
   controller is developed by designing a command governor and a
   disturbance observer. Specifically, the disturbance observer is
   developed to estimate the lumped disturbance composed of parametric
   model uncertainties, modeling errors, and unknown environmental forces.
   The command governor is designed for optimizing command signals in the
   receding horizon within the state and input constraints. The command
   governor is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic
   programming problem. To facilitate online implementations, a
   neurodynamic optimization method based on a one-layer recurrent neural
   network is employed for solving the quadratic optimization problem
   subject to inequality constraints with finite-time convergence. The
   efficacy of the proposed antidisturbance constrained control method for
   autonomous underwater vehicles is substantiated via simulations and
   comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents continuous-time multiagent systems for distributed
   minimax optimization subject to bounded constraints. All agents in the
   system are divided into two groups for minimization and maximization.
   The multiagent system features competitive intergroup interactions and
   cooperative intragroup interactions, both of which are based on the
   output information of agents. First, a proportional-integral (PI)
   intragroup interaction rule is utilized for consensus within each group
   in the system. With this interaction rule, the system is proved to be
   convergent to an optimal solution to the problem, under a certain
   requirement on the intergroup interactions. Second, another
   discontinuous intragroup interaction rule is introduced. It is proved
   that the system with such an interaction is still convergent to an
   optimal solution if the proportional gain exceeds a derived lower bound,
   without the previous requirement on the intergroup interactions. As a
   special case, the systems are further applied for distributed
   optimization. Finally, simulation results are presented to substantiate
   the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a collaborative neurodynamic optimization approach is
   applied for bicriteria portfolio selection in the Markowitz
   mean-variance framework. The bicriteria portfolio selection problem
   consists of two objectives (risk and return) which are scalarized using
   a weighted Chebyshev function. Multiple neurodynamic optimization models
   are used to generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Particle swarm
   optimization is used to diversify the Pareto-optimal solutions by
   optimizing the weights of the scalarized objective functions.
   Experimental results show the superiority of the applied approach.}},

Abstract = {{The robust Huber's M-estimator is widely used in signal and image
   processing, classification, and regression. From an optimization point
   of view, Huber's M-estimation problem is often formulated as a
   large-sized quadratic programming (QP) problem in view of its nonsmooth
   cost function. This paper presents a generalized regression estimator
   which minimizes a reduced-sized QP problem. The generalized regression
   estimator may be viewed as a significant generalization of several
   robust regression estimators including Huber's M-estimator. The
   performance of the generalized regression estimator is analyzed in terms
   of robustness and approximation accuracy. Furthermore, two
   low-dimensional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are introduced for
   robust estimation. The two RNNs have low model complexity and enhanced
   computational efficiency. Finally, the experimental results of two
   examples and an application to image restoration are presented to
   substantiate superior performance of the proposed method over
   conventional algorithms for robust regression estimation in terms of
   approximation accuracy and convergence rate.}},

Abstract = {{There are two ultimate goals in multiobjective optimization. The primary
   goal is to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions while the secondary
   goal is to obtain evenly distributed solutions to characterize the
   efficient frontier. In this paper, a collaborative neurodynamic approach
   to multiobjective optimization is presented to attain both goals of
   Pareto optimality and solution diversity. The multiple objectives are
   first scalarized using a weighted Chebyshev function. Multiple
   projection neural networks are employed to search for Pareto-optimal
   solutions with the help of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
   in reintialization. To diversify the Pareto-optimal solutions, a
   holistic approach is proposed by maximizing the hypervolume (HV) using
   again a PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed
   approach outperforms three other state-of-the- art multiobjective
   algorithms (i.e., HMOEA/D, MOEA/DD, and NSGAIII) most of times on 37
   benchmark datasets in terms of HV and inverted generational distance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with global asymptotic stability of a neural
   network with a time-varying delay, where the delay function is
   differentiable uniformly bounded with delay-derivative bounded from
   above. First, a general reciprocally convex inequality is presented by
   introducing some slack vectors with flexible dimensions. This inequality
   provides a tighter bound in the form of a convex combination than some
   existing ones. Second, by constructing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional, global asymptotic stability of the neural network is
   analyzed for two types of the time-varying delays depending on whether
   or not the lower bound of the delay derivative is known. Third, noticing
   that sufficient conditions on stability from estimation on the
   derivative of some Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional are affine both on the
   delay function and its derivative, allowable delay sets can be refined
   to produce less conservative stability criteria for the neural network
   under study. Finally, two numerical examples are given to substantiate
   the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Land cover classification using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar
   (PolSAR) images is an important tool for remote sensing analysis. In
   view that PolSAR image effective interpretation is commonly affected by
   the absence of discriminative features and the presence of speckle
   noises, this letter proposes an adaptive nonlocal stacked sparse
   autoencoder (ANSSAE) to achieve PolSAR image classification. It extracts
   the adaptive nonlocal spatial information by adaptively calculating
   weighted average values of each pixel from nonlocal regions, which can
   reduce the influence of speckle noises and retain edge details. In the
   first layer of the ANSSAE, the adaptive nonlocal spatial information is
   introduced into the objective function to obtain the robust feature
   representation, whose effects would transfer to the rest of layers.
   Therefore, the ANSSAE can automatically capture spatial-related, robust,
   and distinguishable features, which can suppress speckle noises and gain
   accurate classification results. Experimental results on two real PolSAR
   images demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve
   the classification accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the coexistence of multiple equilibrium

   Based on a state space partition by using the geometrical properties of

   can exhibit Pi(n)(i=1)(2K(i) + 1) equilibrium points with K-i >= 0. In
   particular, several sufficient criteria are proposed to ascertain the
   asymptotical stability of Pi(n)(i=1) (K-i + 1) equilibrium points for
   recurrent neural networks. These theoretical results cover both
   monostability and multistability. Furthermore, the attraction basins of
   asymptotically stable equilibrium points are estimated. It is shown that
   the attraction basins of the stable equilibrium points can be larger
   than their originally partitioned subsets. Finally, the results are
   illustrated by using the simulation results of four examples.}},

Abstract = {{This brief is concerned with the distributed maneuvering of multiple
   autonomous surface vehicles guided by a virtual leader moving along a
   parameterized path. In the guidance loop, a distributed guidance law is
   developed by incorporating a constant bearing strategy into a
   path-maneuvering design such that a prescribed formation pattern can be
   reached. To optimize the guidance signal under velocity constraint as
   well as minimize control torque during transient phase, an
   optimization-based command governor is employed to generate an optimal
   guidance signal for vehicle kinetics. The optimization problem is
   formulated as a bound-constrained quadratic programming problem, which
   is solved using a recurrent neural network. In the control loop, an
   estimator is developed where a fuzzy system is used to approximate
   unknown kinetics based on input and output data. Next, a kinetic control
   law is constructed based on the optimal command signal and the
   fuzzy-system-based estimator. By virtue of cascade stability analysis,
   it is proven that distributed maneuvering errors converge to a residual
   set. The simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design method for outputfeedback path-following
   control of under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles moving in a
   vertical plane without using surge, heave, and pitch velocities.
   Specifically, an extended state observer (ESO) is developed to recover
   the unmeasured velocities as well as to estimate total uncertainty
   induced by internal model uncertainty and external disturbance. At the
   kinematic level, a commanded guidance law is developed based on a
   vertical line-of-sight guidance scheme and the observed velocities. To
   optimize guidance signals, optimization-based reference governors are
   formulated as bound-constrained quadratic programming problems for
   computing optimal reference signals. Two globally convergent recurrent
   neural networks called projection neural networks are used to solve the
   optimization problems in real-time. Based on the optimal reference
   signals and ESO, a kinetic control law with disturbance rejection
   capability is constructed at the kinetic level. It is proved that all
   error signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly and ultimately
   bounded. Simulation results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed
   method for output-feedback path-following of under-actuated autonomous

Abstract = {{This paper presents a neurodynamic optimization approach to bilevel
   quadratic programming (BQP). Based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
   theorem, the BQP problem is reduced to a one-level mathematical program
   subject to complementarity constraints (MPCC). It is proved that the
   global solution of the MPCC is the minimal one of the optimal solutions
   to multiple convex optimization subproblems. A recurrent neural network
   is developed for solving these convex optimization subproblems. From any
   initial state, the state of the proposed neural network is convergent to
   an equilibrium point of the neural network, which is just the optimal
   solution of the convex optimization subproblem. Compared with existing
   recurrent neural networks for BQP, the proposed neural network is
   guaranteed for delivering the exact optimal solutions to any convex BQP
   problems. Moreover, it is proved that the proposed neural network for
   bilevel linear programming is convergent to an equilibrium point in
   finite time. Finally, three numerical examples are elaborated to
   substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is an advanced method for
   nonnegative feature extraction, with widespread applications. However,
   the NMF solution often entails to solve a global optimization problem
   with a nonconvex objective function and nonnegativity constraints. This
   paper presents a collective neurodynamic optimization (CNO) approach to
   this challenging problem. The proposed collective neurodynamic system
   consists of a population of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) at the
   lower level and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with
   wavelet mutation at the upper level. The RNNs act as search agents
   carrying out precise local searches according to their neurodynamics and
   initial conditions. The PSO algorithm coordinates and guides the RNNs
   with updated initial states toward global optimal solution(s). A wavelet
   mutation operator is added to enhance PSO exploration diversity. Through
   iterative interaction and improvement of the locally best solutions of
   RNNs and global best positions of the whole population, the
   population-based neurodynamic systems are almost sure able to achieve
   the global optimality for the NMF problem. It is proved that the
   convergence of the group-best state to the global optimal solution with
   probability one. The experimental results substantiate the efficacy and
   superiority of the CNO approach to bound-constrained global optimization
   with several benchmark nonconvex functions and NMF-based clustering with
   benchmark data sets in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a predictor-based neural dynamic surface control
   (PNDSC) design method for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in a
   strict-feedback form. In contrast to existing NDSC approaches where the
   tracking errors are commonly used to update neural network weights, a
   predictor is proposed for every subsystem, and the prediction errors are
   employed to update the neural adaptation laws. The proposed scheme
   enables smooth and fast identification of system dynamics without
   incurring high-frequency oscillations, which are unavoidable using
   classical NDSC methods. Furthermore, the result is extended to the PNDSC
   with observer feedback, and its robustness against measurement noise is
   analyzed. Numerical and experimental results are given to demonstrate
   the efficacy of the proposed PNDSC architecture.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note presents a continuous-time multi-agent system for

   without the need to be globally convex. All agents in the system
   communicate using a proportional-integral protocol with their output
   information instead of state information to reduce communication
   bandwidth. It is proved that all agents with any initial state can reach
   output consensus at an optimal solution to the given constrained
   optimization problem, provided that the graph describing the
   communication links among agents is undirected and connected. It is
   further proved that the system with only integral protocol is also
   convergent to the unique optimal solution if each individual objective

   is not required to be always connected and can switch ON and OFF at
   different impulse instants. By using the concept of sequential
   connectivity and the properties of stochastic matrices, a set of
   sufficient conditions depending on time delays is derived to ascertain
   global synchronization of multiple continuous-time recurrent NNs. In
   addition, a counterpart on the global synchronization of multiple

Abstract = {{In this paper, a neurodynamics-based output feedback scheme is proposed
   for distributed containment maneuvering of marine vessels guided by
   multiple parameterized paths without using velocity measurements. Each
   vessel is subject to internal model uncertainties and external
   disturbances induced by wind, waves, and ocean currents. In order to
   recover unmeasured velocity information as well as to identify unknown
   vessel dynamics, an echo state network (ESN) based observer using
   recorded input-output data is proposed for each vessel. Based on the
   observed velocity information of neighboring vessels, distributed
   containment maneuvering laws are developed at the kinematic level. Next,
   in order to shape the transient motion profile for vessel kinetics to
   follow, finite-time nonlinear tracking differentiators are employed to
   generate smooth reference signals as well as to extract the time
   derivatives of kinematic control laws. Finally, ESN-based dynamic
   control laws are constructed at the kinetic level. The stability of the
   closed-loop system is analyzed via input-to-state stability and cascade
   theory. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of
   the proposed neurodynamics-based output feedback approach.}},

Abstract = {{Global optimization is a long-lasting research topic in the field of
   optimization, posting many challenging theoretic and computational
   issues. This paper presents a novel collective neurodynamic method for
   solving constrained global optimization problems. At first, a one-layer
   recurrent neural network (RNN) is presented for searching the
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the optimization problem under study. Next,
   a collective neuroydnamic optimization approach is developed by
   emulating the paradigm of brainstorming. Multiple RNNs are exploited
   cooperatively to search for the global optimal solutions in a framework
   of particle swarm optimization. Each RNN carries out a precise local
   search and converges to a candidate solution according to its own
   neurodynamics. The neuronal state of each neural network is repetitively
   reset by exchanging historical information of each individual network
   and the entire group. Wavelet mutation is performed to avoid
   prematurity, add diversity, and promote global convergence. It is proved
   in the framework of stochastic optimization that the proposed collective
   neurodynamic approach is capable of computing the global optimal
   solutions with probability one provided that a sufficiently large number
   of neural networks are utilized. The essence of the collective
   neurodynamic optimization approach lies in its potential to solve
   constrained global optimization problems in real time. The effectiveness
   and characteristics of the proposed approach are illustrated by using
   benchmark optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{The containment maneuvering of marine surface vehicles has two
   objectives. The first one is to force the marine vehicles to follow a
   convex hull spanned by multiple parameterized paths. The second one is
   to meet the requirement of a desired dynamic behavior along multiple
   paths during containment. A modular design approach to the containment
   maneuvering of marine surface vehicles is presented. At first, an
   estimator module using a recurrent neural network is proposed to
   estimate the unknown kinetics induced by model uncertainty, unmodeled
   dynamics, and environmental disturbances. Next, a controller module is
   developed based on a distributed path maneuvering design and a linear
   tracking differentiator. Finally, two path update laws based on a
   maneuvering error feedback and a filtering update scheme, respectively,
   are constructed. The estimator-controller pair forms a cascade system,
   which is proved to be input-to-state stable. The developed controller
   has a desirable spatial-temporal decoupling property, and geometric and
   dynamic objectives can be achieved separately. Results of comparative
   studies are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a collective neurodynamic optimization approach is
   proposed to nonnegative tensor factorization. Tensor decompositions are
   often applied in the data analysis. However, it is often a nonconvex
   optimization problem, which would cost much time and usually trap into
   the local minima To solve this problem, a novel collective neurodynamic
   optimization approach is proposed by combining recurrent neural networks
   (RNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Each RNN still
   carries out local search. And then the best solution of each RNN
   improves through PSO framework. In the end, the global optimal solutions
   of nonnegative tensor factorization are obtained. Experiments results
   demonstrate the effectiveness for the nonconvex optimization with
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Floating raft aquaculture is a significant part of the mariculture, and
   its recognition is conducive to the dynamic monitoring of sea area. The
   satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image can overcome the
   uncertainties of marine meteorological environment and reflect the
   location of floating raft aquaculture. However, oceanic SAR images are
   seriously contaminated by speckle noise, and effective features of SAR
   images are deficient, which make recognition difficult. Modified
   statistical region merging (SRM) algorithm is utilized to accomplish
   superpixels segmentation, which weakens the contamination of speckle
   noise. Non-subsampled contourlet transform is adopted to obtain contour
   feature to enrich the data information for subsequent processing. After
   that, using fuzzy compactness and separation can unsupervised recognize
   the target of floating raft aquaculture. In the experiment, the
   Radarsat-2 SAR data in the adjacent sea area of Changhai County in
   Liaoning Province is chosen to test the proposed method. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the
   recognition accuracy, and obtains the area of floating raft aquaculture
   with smooth boundary and less isolated noise points.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the complete stability of delayed recurrent neural
   networks with Gaussian activation functions. By means of the geometrical
   properties of Gaussian function and algebraic properties of nonsingular
   M-matrix, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that for an
   n-neuron neural network, there are exactly 3(k) equilibrium points with
   0 <= k <= n, among which 2(k) and 3(k) - 2(k) equilibrium points are
   locally exponentially stable and unstable, respectively. Moreover, it
   concludes that all the states converge to one of the equilibrium points;
   i.e., the neural networks are completely stable. The derived conditions
   herein can be easily tested. Finally, a numerical example is given to
   illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   stability of the observer is analyzed via Lyapunov analysis. The
   proposed observer can be used in various motion control scenario, such

Abstract = {{As a kind of kernel methods, kernel recursive least squares has
   attracted wide attention in the research of time series online
   prediction. It has low computational complexity and updates in the shape
   of recursive increment. However, with the increase of data size,
   computational complexity of calculating kernel inverse matrix will
   raise. In addition, in the process of online prediction, it cannot
   accommodate dynamic environment commendably. It is difficult to meet the
   demand of prediction accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. Therefore,
   this paper presents an improved kernel recursive least squares algorithm
   for multivariate chaotic time series online prediction. We apply dynamic
   adjustment and coherence criterions to propose adaptive normalized
   sparse kernel recursive least squares (ANSKRLS) method. In our method,
   the size of kernel matrix can be reduced, so that computational
   complexity drops. And ANSKRLS has the ability to operate online and
   adjust weights adaptively in time-varying environments. The proposed
   method has been simulated on Lorenz time series and ENSO related indexes
   time series. Simulation results prove that ANS-KRLS performs well on
   prediction accuracy and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, researchers show great interest in Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicle(UAV) path planning problem due to development of artificial
   intelligence algorithms. However, the convergence of these kinds of
   heuristic methods can not be proved. Therefore, the UAV path planning
   problem has been modeled as a linear optimal control problem to ensure
   the convergence. But the computing time will increase exponentially as
   the scale of the problem enlarge. Hence, the Receding Horizon
   Control(RHC) is introduced to the problem to guarantee the efficiency.
   Nevertheless, how to choose a proper receding horizon span to keep
   balance between efficiency and accuracy becomes a new problem. An
   adaptive strategy is proposed to choose a proper parameter to meet the
   real-time requirement and fuel consuming in this paper. The strategy has
   better performance in the two simulation scenes, which indicates the
   effectiveness of the algorithm.}},
