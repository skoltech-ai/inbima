Abstract = {{Modern algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
   extremely useful in solving a variety of complicated problems in
   computer vision, robust control, and natural language analysis of sound
   and texts as applied to data processing, robotics, etc. However, for the
   ANN approach to be successfully incorporated into critically important
   systems, for example, in medicine or jurisprudence, a clear
   interpretation is required for the internal architecture of ANN and for
   ANN-based decision-making processes. In recent years, analysis methods
   based on various visualization techniques applied to computation graphs,
   loss function profiles, parameters of single network layers, and even
   single neurons have become especially popular as tools for creating
   explainable deep learning models. This survey systematizes existing
   mathematical analysis methods and explanations of the behavior of
   underlying algorithms and presents formulations of corresponding
   problems in computational mathematics. The study and visualization of
   deep neural networks are new poorly studied yet rapidly developing
   areas. The considered methods give a deeper insight into the operation
   of neural network algorithms.}},
