Abstract = {{We propose a new hybrid algorithm that allows incorporating both user
   and item side information within the standard collaborative filtering
   technique. One of its key features is that it naturally extends a simple
   PureSVD approach and inherits its unique advantages, such as highly
   efficient Lanczos-based optimization procedure, simplified
   hyper-parameter tuning and a quick folding-in computation for generating
   recommendations instantly even in highly dynamic online environments.
   The algorithm utilizes a generalized formulation of the singular value
   decomposition, which adds flexibility to the solution and allows
   imposing the desired structure on its latent space. Conveniently, the
   resulting model also admits an efficient and straightforward solution
   for the cold start scenario. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set
   of datasets and show its superiority over similar classes of hybrid
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A substantial progress in development of new and efficient tensor
   factorization techniques has led to an extensive research of their
   applicability in recommender systems field. Tensor-based recommender
   models push the boundaries of traditional collaborative filtering
   techniques by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real
   environments, which allows to produce more accurate, situational (e.g.,
   context-aware and criteria-driven) recommendations. Despite the
   promising results, tensor-based methods are poorly covered in existing
   recommender systems surveys. This survey aims to complement previous
   works and provide a comprehensive overview on the subject. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consolidate studies from
   various application domains, which helps to get a notion of the current
   state of the field. We also provide a high level discussion of the
   future perspectives and directions for further improvement of
   tensor-based recommendation systems. (C) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd}},
