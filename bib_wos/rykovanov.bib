Title = {{Relativistic modified Bessel-Gaussian beam generated from plasma-based
   beam braiding}},

Volume = {{104}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically and numerically demonstrate the generation of a
   relativistic modified Bessel-Gaussian beam (MBGB) via plasma-based beam
   braiding. It is realized by injecting several intense Gaussian pulses
   with well-designed offsets and angles into an underdense plasma channel
   which acts as a laser-pulse combiner via refractive coupling. The MBGB
   propagates stably in the plasma channel with a well-controlled orbital
   angular momentum of large value, exciting a twisted plasma wave. After
   leaving the plasma, it becomes unguided and survives in vacuum for at
   least hundreds of femtoseconds. This method is insensitive to the
   initial laser injection conditions and thus should be robust for
   experimental implementation. It provides an alternative approach in
   generating high-quality tunable intense optical vortex beams which are
   desired for various applications.}},

Title = {{Narrow Bandwidth Gamma Comb from Nonlinear Compton Scattering Using the

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Nonlinear Compton scattering is a promising source of bright gamma rays.
   Using readily available intense laser pulses to scatter off the
   energetic electrons, on the one hand, allows us to significantly
   increase the total photon yield, but on the other hand, leads to a
   dramatic spectral broadening of the fundamental emission line as well as
   its harmonics due to the laser pulse shape induced ponderomotive
   effects. In this Letter we propose to avoid ponderomotive broadening in
   harmonics by using the polarization gating technique-a well-known method
   to construct a laser pulse with temporally varying polarization. We show
   that by restricting harmonic emission only to the region near the peak
   of the pulse, where the polarization is linear, it is possible to
   generate a bright narrow bandwidth comb in the gamma region.}},

Abstract = {{High-energy radiation can be generated by colliding a relativistic
   electron bunch with a high-intensity laser pulse-a process known as
   Thomson scattering. In the nonlinear regime the emitted radiation
   contains harmonics. For a laser pulse whose length is comparable to its

   field strength (i.e., capable of fully separating electrons from the ion
   background), the addition of a second harmonic field results in the
   stabilization of the foil up to the blow-out intensity. This is then
   followed by a sharp transition to transparency that essentially occurs
   in a single optical cycle. During the transition cycle, a dense,
   nanometer-scale electron bunch is accelerated to relativistic velocities
   and emits a single, strong attosecond pulse with a peak intensity
   approaching that of the laser field.}},

Abstract = {{Light beams with helical phase-fronts are known to carry orbital angular
   momentum (OAM) and provide an additional degree of freedom to beams of
   coherent light. While OAM beams can be readily derived from Gaussian
   laser beams with phase plates or gratings, this is far more challenging
   in the extreme ultra-violet (XUV), especially for the case of high XUV
   intensity. Here, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that
   intense surface harmonics carrying OAM are naturally produced by the
   intrinsic dynamics of a relativistically intense circularly-polarized
   Gaussian beam (i.e. non-vortex) interacting with a target at normal
   incidence. Relativistic surface oscillations convert the laser pulses to
   intense XUV harmonic radiation via the well-known relativistic
   oscillating mirror mechanism. We show that the azimuthal and radial
   dependence of the harmonic generation process converts the spin angular
   momentum of the laser beam to orbital angular momentum resulting in an
   intense attosecond pulse (or pulse train) with OAM.}},

Title = {{High-quality high-order harmonic generation through preplasma truncation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{By introducing preplasma truncation to cases with an initial preplasma
   scale length larger than 0.2 lambda, the efficiency of high-order
   harmonics generated from relativistic laser-solid interactions can be
   enhanced by more than one order of magnitude and the angular spread can
   be confined into near-diffraction-limited divergence. Numerical
   simulations show that density truncation results in more compact
   oscillation of the surface electron sheet and the curvature of the
   reflection surface for the driving laser is greatly reduced. This leads
   to an overall improvement in the harmonic beam quality. More
   importantly, density truncation makes the harmonic generation weakly
   dependent on the preplasma scale length, which provides a way to relax
   the extremely high requirement on the temporal contrast of the driving
   laser pulse. A feasible scheme to realize the required preplasma
   truncation is also proposed and demonstrated by numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A plasma channel undulator/wiggler may be created through the plasma
   wakefield excited by the beating of several Hermite-Gaussian laser modes
   propagating in a parabolic plasma channel. Control over both the
   betatron and undulator forces is conveniently achieved by tuning the
   amplitude ratios, colors, and order numbers of the modes. A special
   structure of the undulator/wiggler field without the focusing force near
   the propagation axis is generated inside the plasma wakefield by
   matching the strengths of the fundamental and first-order
   Hermite-Gaussian modes. The electron beam only experiences forced
   undulator oscillations in such a field, which significantly improves the
   quality of the emitted radiation. Since the value of the undulator
   strength parameter could be in a wide range, less or larger than unity,
   it is capable of generating narrow bandwidth x-ray, as well as the
   synchrotronlike high-energy x/gamma-ray, radiation by harmonics.
   Additionally, controlling the relative phases between the laser modes
   allows for polarization control of the plasma undulator. High-order
   harmonics produced from a circularly polarized plasma undulator clearly
   show the vortex nature and carry well-defined orbital angular momentum.}},

   describe a simple method to generate optimized laser pulses that
   compensate the nonlinear spectrum broadening and can be thought of as a
   superposition of two oppositely linearly chirped pulses delayed with
   respect to each other. We develop a simple analytical model that allows
   us to predict the optimal parameters of such a two-pulse-the delay,
   amount of chirp, and relative phase-for generation of a narrow-band
   gamma-ray spectrum. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical
   optimization and simulations including three-dimensional effects.}},

Abstract = {{Long distance propagation of an energetic laser pulse with intensity
   slightly below that for multi-photon ionization in air is considered
   analytically, by noting that in the process, it is mainly the peak
   region of the pulse that interacts with the air molecules. Similar to
   that of much shorter femtosecond laser pulses of similar intensity, the
   affected air becomes slightly ionized and self-consistently forms a
   co-propagating thin and low-density plasma filament along the axis. It
   is found that a hundred-Joule-level laser pulse with a relatively large
   spot radius and pulse duration can propagate (also in the form of a
   self-consistent filament) tens of kilometers through the atmosphere.
   Such laser propagation properties should have applications in many
   areas. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of protons accelerated from submicron-thick
   plastic foil targets using multi-terawatt, frequency-doubled laser
   pulses with ultra-high temporal contrast has been investigated
   experimentally. A very stable, ring-like beam profile of the accelerated
   protons, oriented around the target's normal direction has been
   observed. The ring's opening angle has been found to decrease with
   increasing foil thicknesses. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell
   simulations reproduce our results indicating that the ring is formed
   during the expansion of the proton density distribution into the vacuum
   as described by the mechanism of target-normal sheath acceleration.
   Here-in addition to the longitudinal electric fields responsible for the
   forward acceleration of the protons-a lateral charge separation leads to
   transverse field components accelerating the protons in the lateral
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{A flexible gamma-ray radiation source based on the resonant laser-plasma
   wakefield wiggler is proposed. The wiggler is achieved by inducing
   centroid oscillations of a short laser pulse in a plasma channel.
   Electrons (self-)injected in such a wakefield experience both
   oscillations due to the transverse electric fields and energy gain due
   to the longitudinal electric field. The oscillations are significantly
   enhanced when the laser pulse centroid oscillations are in resonance
   with the electron betatron oscillations, extending the radiation
   spectrum to the gamma-ray range. The polarization of the radiation can
   be easily controlled by adjusting the injection of the laser pulse into
   the plasma channel.}},

Title = {{A systematic approach to numerical dispersion in Maxwell solvers}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{273-281}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a well established
   method for solving the time evolution of Maxwell's equations.
   Unfortunately the scheme introduces numerical dispersion and therefore
   phase and group velocities which deviate from the correct values. The
   solution to Maxwell's equations in more than one dimension results in
   non-physical predictions such as numerical dispersion or numerical
   Cherenkov radiation emitted by a relativistic electron beam propagating
   in vacuum.
   Improved solvers, which keep the staggered Yee-type grid for electric
   and magnetic fields, generally modify the spatial derivative operator in
   the Maxwell-Faraday equation by increasing the computational stencil,
   These modified solvers can be characterized by different sets of
   coefficients, leading to different dispersion properties. In this work
   we introduce a norm function to rewrite the choice of coefficients into
   a Minimization problem. We solve this problem numerically and show that
   the minimization procedure leads to phase and group velocities that are
   considerably closer to c as compared to schemes with manually set
   coefficients available in the literature. Depending on a specific
   problem at hand (e.g. electron beam propagation in plasma, high-order
   harmonic generation from plasma surfaces, etc.), the norm function can
   be chosen accordingly, for example, to minimize the numerical dispersion
   in a certain given propagation direction. Particle-in-cell simulations
   of an electron beam propagating in vacuum using our solver are provided.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{A description of the spectral and angular distributions of Compton
   scattered light in collisions of intense laser pulses with high-energy
   electrons is unwieldy and usually requires numerical simulations.
   However, due to the large number of parameters affecting the spectra
   such numerical investigations can become computationally expensive.
   Using methods of catastrophe theory we predict higher-dimensional
   caustics in the spectra of the Compton scattered light, which are
   associated with bright narrow-band spectral lines, and in the simplest
   case can be controlled by the value of the linear chirp of the pulse.
   These findings require no full-scale calculations and have direct
   consequences for the photon yield enhancement of future nonlinear
   Compton scattering x-ray or gamma-ray sources.}},

Title = {{Plasma channel undulator excited by high-order laser modes}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of utilizing plasma undulators and plasma accelerators
   to produce compact ultraviolet and X-ray sources, has attracted
   considerable interest for a few decades. This interest has been driven
   by the great potential to decrease the threshold for accessing such
   sources, which are mainly provided by a few dedicated large-scale
   synchrotron or free-electron laser (FEL) facilities. However, the broad
   radiation bandwidth of such plasma devices limits the source brightness
   and makes it difficult for the FEL instability to develop. Here, using
   multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate
   that a plasma undulator generated by the beating of a mixture of
   high-order laser modes propagating inside a plasma channel, leads to a
   few percent radiation bandwidth. The strength of the undulator can reach
   unity, the period can be less than a millimeter, and the number of
   undulator periods can be significantly increased by a phase locking
   technique based on the longitudinal tapering. Polarization control of
   such an undulator can be achieved by appropriately choosing the phase of
   the modes. According to our results, in the fully beam loaded regime,
   the electron current in the plasma undulator can reach 0.3 kA level,
   making such an undulator a potential candidate towards a table-top FEL.}},

Abstract = {{Energy coupling during relativistically intense laser-matter
   interactions is encoded in the attosecond motion of strongly driven
   electrons at the pre-formed plasma-vacuum boundary. Studying and
   controlling this motion can reveal details about the microscopic
   processes that govern a vast array of light-matter interaction
   phenomena, including those at the forefront of extreme laser-plasma
   science such as laser-driven ion acceleration(1), bright attosecond
   pulse generation(2,3) and efficient energy coupling for the generation
   and study of warm dense matter(4). Here we experimentally demonstrate
   that by precisely adjusting the relative phase of an additional laser
   beam operating at the second harmonic of the driving laser it is
   possible to control the trajectories of relativistic electron bunches
   formed during the interaction with a solid target at the attosecond
   scale. We observe significant enhancements in the resulting
   high-harmonic yield, suggesting potential applications for sources of
   ultra-bright, extreme ultraviolet attosecond radiation to be used in
   atomic and molecular pump-probe experiments(5,6).}},
