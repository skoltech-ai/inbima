Abstract = {{We analyze comparative questions, i.e., questions asking to compare
   different items, that were submitted to Yandex in 2012. Responses to
   such questions might be quite different from the simple ``ten blue
   links{''} and could, for example, aggregate pros and cons of the
   different options as direct answers. However, changing the result
   presentation is an intricate decision such that the classification of
   comparative questions forms a highly precision-oriented task.
   From a year-long Yandex log, we annotate a random sample of 50,000
   questions; 2.8\% of which are comparative. For these annotated
   questions, we develop a precision-oriented classifier by combining
   carefully hand-crafted lexico-syntactic rules with feature based and
   neural approaches achieving a recall of 0.6 at a perfect precision of
   1.0. After running the classifier on the full year log (on average,
   there is at least one comparative question per second), we analyze 6,250
   comparative questions using more fine-grained subclasses (e.g., should
   the answer be a ``simple{''} fact or rather a more verbose argument) for
   which individual classifiers are trained. An important insight is that
   more than 65\% of the comparative questions demand argumentation and
   opinions, i.e., reliable direct answers to comparative questions require
   more than the facts from a search engine's knowledge graph.
   In addition, we present a qualitative analysis of the underlying
   comparative information needs (separated into 14 categories like
   consumer electronics or health), their seasonal dynamics, and possible
   answers from community question answering platforms.}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed theoretical and computational analysis of the
   Watset meta-algorithm for fuzzy graph clustering, which has been found
   to be widely applicable in a variety of domains. This algorithm creates
   an intermediate representation of the input graph, which reflects the
   ``ambiguity{''} of its nodes. Then, it uses hard clustering to discover
   clusters in this ``disambiguated{''} intermediate graph. After outlining
   the approach and analyzing its computational complexity, we demonstrate
   that Watset shows competitive results in three applications:
   unsupervised synset induction from a synonymy graph, unsupervised
   semantic frame induction from dependency triples, and unsupervised
   semantic class induction from a distributional thesaurus. Our algorithm
   is generic and can also be applied to other networks of linguistic data.}},

Abstract = {{The compositionality degree of multiword expressions indicates to what
   extent the meaning of a phrase can be derived from the meaning of its
   constituents and their grammatical relations. Prediction of
   (non)-compositionality is a task that has been frequently addressed with
   distributional semantic models. We introduce a novel technique to blend
   hierarchical information with distributional information for predicting
   compositionality. In particular, we use hypernymy information of the
   multiword and its constituents encoded in the form of the recently
   introduced Poincare embeddings in addition to the distributional
   information to detect compositionality for noun phrases. Using a
   weighted average of the distributional similarity and a Poincare
   similarity function, we obtain consistent and substantial, statistically
   significant improvement across three gold standard datasets over
   state-of-the-art models based on distributional information only. Unlike
   traditional approaches that solely use an unsupervised setting, we have
   also framed the problem as a supervised task, obtaining comparable
   improvements. Further, we publicly release our Poincare embeddings,
   which are trained on the output of handcrafted lexical-syntactic
   patterns on a large corpus.}},

   annotated with compositionality information of noun compounds. The
   compound phrases are collected from the Universal Dependency treebanks

   by two experts and a moderator according to the following schema: the
   phrase can be either compositional, non-compositional, or ambiguous
   (i.e., depending on the context it can be interpreted both as
   compositional or noncompositional). We conduct an experimental
   evaluation of models and methods for predicting compositionality of noun
   compounds in unsupervised and supervised setups. We show that methods
   from previous work evaluated on the proposed Russian-language resource
   achieve the performance comparable with results on English corpora.}},

   have mostly focused on unstructured text data to learn representations

   base itself that should be useful to disambiguate entities. In this

   structured information from the knowledge base with unstructured
   information from text-based representations. Our experiments confirm

Abstract = {{Active learning is a technique that helps to minimize the annotation
   budget required for the creation of a labeled dataset while maximizing
   the performance of a model trained on this dataset. It has been shown
   that active learning can be successfully applied to sequence tagging
   tasks of text processing in conjunction with deep learning models even
   when a limited amount of labeled data is available. Recent advances in
   transfer learning methods for natural language processing based on deep
   pre-trained models such as ELMo and BERT offer a much better ability to
   generalize on small annotated datasets compared to their shallow
   counterparts. The combination of deep pre-trained models and active
   learning leads to a powerful approach to dealing with annotation
   scarcity. In this work, we investigate the potential of this approach on
   clinical and biomedical data. The experimental evaluation shows that the
   combination of active learning and deep pre-trained models outperforms
   the standard methods of active learning. We also suggest a modification
   to a standard uncertainty sampling strategy and empirically show that it
   could be beneficial for annotation of very skewed datasets. Finally, we
   propose an annotation tool empowered with active learning and deep
   pre-trained models that could be used for entity annotation directly
   from Jupyter IDE.}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach to combining distributional semantic
   representations induced from text corpora with manually constructed
   lexical semantic networks. While both kinds of semantic resources are
   available with high lexical coverage, our aligned resource combines the
   domain specificity and availability of contextual information from
   distributional models with the conciseness and high quality of manually
   crafted lexical networks. We start with a distributional representation
   of induced senses of vocabulary terms, which are accompanied with rich
   context information given by related lexical items. We then
   automatically disambiguate such representations to obtain a full-fledged
   proto-conceptualization, i.e. a typed graph of induced word senses. In a
   final step, this proto-conceptualization is aligned to a lexical
   ontology, resulting in a hybrid aligned resource. Moreover, unmapped
   induced senses are associated with a semantic type in order to connect
   them to the core resource. Manual evaluations against ground-truth
   judgments for different stages of our method as well as an extrinsic
   evaluation on a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation benchmark all
   indicate the high quality of the new hybrid resource. Additionally, we
   show the benefits of enriching top-down lexical knowledge resources with
   bottom-up distributional information from text for addressing high-end
   knowledge acquisition tasks such as cleaning hypernym graphs and
   learning taxonomies from scratch.}},

Abstract = {{Graph-based synset induction methods, such as MaxMax and WATSET, induce
   synsets by performing a global clustering of a synonymy graph. However,
   such methods are sensitive to the structure of the input synonymy graph:
   sparseness of the input dictionary can substantially reduce the quality
   of the extracted synsets. In this paper, we propose two different
   approaches designed to alleviate the incompleteness of the input
   dictionaries. The first one performs a pre-processing of the graph by
   adding missing edges, while the second one performs a post-processing by
   merging similar synset clusters. We evaluate these approaches on two
   datasets for the Russian language and discuss their impact on the
   performance of synset induction methods. Finally, we perform an
   extensive error analysis of each approach and discuss prominent
   alternative methods for coping with the problem of sparsity of the
   synonymy dictionaries.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic relatedness of terms represents similarity of meaning by a
   numerical score. On the one hand, humans easily make judgements about
   semantic relatedness. On the other hand, this kind of information is
   useful in language processing systems. While semantic relatedness has
   been extensively studied for English using numerous language resources,
   such as associative norms, human judgements and datasets generated from
   lexical databases, no evaluation resources of this kind have been
   available for Russian to date. Our contribution addresses this problem.
   We present five language resources of different scale and purpose for
   Russian semantic relatedness, each being a list of triples (wordi,
   wordj, similarityij). Four of them are designed for evaluation of
   systems for computing semantic relatedness, complementing each other in
   terms of the semantic relation type they represent. These benchmarks
   were used to organise a shared task on Russian semantic relatedness,
   which attracted 19 teams. We use one of the best approaches identified
   in this competition to generate the fifth high-coverage resource, the
   first open distributional thesaurus of Russian. Multiple evaluations of
   this thesaurus, including a large-scale crowdsourcing study involving
   native speakers, indicate its high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present Mnogoznal, an unsupervised system for word
   sense disambiguation. Given a sentence, the system chooses the most
   relevant sense of each input word w.r.t. to the semantic similarity
   between the given sentence and the synset constituting the sense of the
   target word. Mnogoznal has two modes of operation. The sparse mode uses
   the traditional vector space model to estimate the most similar word
   sense corresponding to its context. The dense mode, instead, uses synset
   embeddings to cope with the sparsity problem. We describe the
   architecture of the present system and also conduct its preliminary
   evaluation on three different lexical semantic resources for Russian. We
   found that the dense mode substantially outperform the sparse one on all
   the datasets as according to the adjusted Rand index computed on a gold
   standard dataset.}},

   The two most recurrent tasks are extraction of synsets and semantic

   interlinks all main lexical resources providing a unified assess to
   them. In this paper, we present BabelNet Extract, an open source tool
   which helps in addressing these two recurrent extraction tasks
   effectively in a parallelized manner from the large-scale multilingual
   BabelNet semantic network. The tool extracts individual word senses and
   the synsets they form as well as the semantic relations established
   between the synsets. We show its architecture, describe the output

   ambiguous words. Finally, we cluster the disambiguated version of the
   ambiguous input graph into synsets. Our meta-clustering approach lets us
   use an efficient hard clustering algorithm to perform a fuzzy clustering
   of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our approach shows excellent
   results, outperforming five competitive state-of-the-art methods in
