Abstract = {{Background: P300-based brain-computer interfaces provide communication
   pathways without the need for muscle activity by recognizing electrical
   signals from the brain. The P300 speller is one of the most commonly
   used BCI applications, as it is very simple and reliable, and it is
   capable of reaching satisfactory communication performance. However, as
   with other BCIs, it remains a challenge to improve the P300 speller's
   performance to increase its practical usability. New methods: In this
   study, we propose a novel multi-feature subset fuzzy fusion (MSFF)
   framework for the P300 speller to recognize the users' spelling
   intention. This method includes two parts: 1) feature selection by the
   Lasso algorithm and feature division; 2) the construction of ensemble
   LDA classifiers and the fuzzy fusion of those classifiers to recognize
   user intention. Results: The proposed framework is evaluated in three
   public datasets and achieves an average accuracy of 100\% after 4 epochs
   for BCI Competition II Dataset IIb, 96\% for BCI Competition III dataset
   II and 98.3\% for the BNCI Horizon Dataset. It indicates that the
   proposed MSFF method can make use of temporal information of signals and
   helps to enhance classification performance. Comparison with existing
   methods: The proposed MSFF method yields better or comparable
   performance than previously reported machine learning algorithms.
   Conclusions: The proposed MSFF method is able to improve the performance
   of P300-based BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{Research on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has become more democratic
   in recent decades, and experiments using electroencephalography
   (EEG)-based BCIs has dramatically increased. The variety of protocol
   designs and the growing interest in physiological computing require
   parallel improvements in processing and classification of both EEG
   signals and bio signals, such as electrodermal activity (EDA), heart
   rate (HR) or breathing. If some EEG-based analysis tools are already
   available for online BCIs with a number of online BCI platforms (e.g.,
   BCI2000 or OpenViBE), it remains crucial to perform offline analyses in
   order to design, select, tune, validate and test algorithms before using
   them online. Moreover, studying and comparing those algorithms usually
   requires expertise in programming, signal processing and machine
   learning, whereas numerous BCI researchers come from other backgrounds
   with limited or no training in such skills. Finally, existing BCI
   toolboxes are focused on EEG and other brain signals but usually do not
   include processing tools for other bio signals. Therefore, in this
   paper, we describe BioPyC, a free, open-source and easy-to-use Python
   platform for offline EEG and biosignal processing and classification.
   Based on an intuitive and well-guided graphical interface, four main
   modules allow the user to follow the standard steps of the BCI process
   without any programming skills: (1) reading different neurophysiological
   signal data formats, (2) filtering and representing EEG and bio signals,
   (3) classifying them, and (4) visualizing and performing statistical
   tests on the results. We illustrate BioPyC use on four studies, namely
   classifying mental tasks, the cognitive workload, emotions and attention
   states from EEG signals.}},

Journal = {{MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Completing a data tensor with structured missing components is a
   challenging task where the missing components are not distributed
   randomly but they admit some regular patterns, e.g. missing columns and
   rows or missing blocks/patches. Many of the existing tensor completion
   algorithms are not able to handle such scenarios. In this paper, we
   propose a novel and efficient approach for matrix/tensor completion by
   applying Hankelization and distributed tensor ring decomposition. Our
   main idea is first Hankelizing an incomplete data tensor in order to
   obtain high-order tensors and then completing the data tensor by
   imposing sparse representation on the core tensors in tensor ring
   format. We apply an efficient over-complete discrete cosine transform
   dictionary and sparse representation techniques to learn core tensors.
   Alternating direction methods of multiplier and accelerated proximal
   gradient approaches are used to solve the underlying optimization
   problems. Extensive simulations performed on image, video completions
   and time series forecasting show the validity and applicability of the
   method for different kinds of structured and random missing elements.}},

Abstract = {{Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces help patients with
   movement disorders to regain the ability to control external devices.
   Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a popular algorithm for feature
   extraction in decoding MI tasks. However, due to noise and
   nonstationarity in electroencephalography (EEG), it is not optimal to
   combine the corresponding features obtained from the traditional CSP
   algorithm. In this paper, we designed a novel CSP feature selection
   framework that combines the filter method and the wrapper method. We
   first evaluated the importance of every CSP feature by the infinite
   latent feature selection method. Meanwhile, we calculated Wasserstein
   distance between feature distributions of the same feature under
   different tasks. Then, we redefined the importance of every CSP feature
   based on two indicators mentioned above, which eliminates half of CSP
   features to create a new CSP feature subspace according to the new
   importance indicator. At last, we designed the improved binary
   gravitational search algorithm (IBGSA) by rebuilding its transfer
   function and applied IBGSA on the new CSP feature subspace to find the
   optimal feature set. To validate the proposed method, we conducted
   experiments on three public BCI datasets and performed a numerical
   analysis of the proposed algorithm for MI classification. The accuracies
   were comparable to those reported in related studies and the presented
   model outperformed other methods in literature on the same underlying
   data.}},

   framework for motor imagery-based brain-computer interface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Spatial and spectral features extracted from
   electroencephalogram (EEG) are critical for the classification of motor
   imagery (MI) tasks. As prevalently used methods, the common spatial
   pattern (CSP) and filter bank CSP (FBCSP) can effectively extract
   spatial-spectral features from MI-related EEG. To further improve the
   separability of the CSP features, we proposed a distinguishable
   spatial-spectral feature learning neural network (DSSFLNN) framework for
   MI-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in this study. Approach. The
   first step of the DSSFLNN framework was to extract FBCSP features from
   raw EEG signals. Then two squeeze-and-excitation modules were used to
   re-calibrate CSP features along the band-wise axis and the class-wise
   axis, respectively. Next, we used a parallel convolutional neural
   network module to learn distinguishable spatial-spectral features.
   Finally, the distinguishable spatial-spectral features were fed to a
   fully connected layer for classification. To verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed framework, we compared it with the state-of-the-art methods
   on BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b. Main results. The results
   showed that the DSSFLNN framework can achieve a mean Cohen's kappa value
   of 0.7 on two datasets, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.
   Moreover, two additional experiments were conducted and they proved that
   the combination of band-wise feature learning and class-wise feature
   learning can achieve significantly better performance than only using
   either one of them. Significance. The proposed DSSFLNN can effectively
   improve the decoding performance of MI-based BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{During the acquisition of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, data
   may be missing or corrupted by noise and artifacts. To reconstruct the
   incomplete data, EEG signals are firstly converted into a three-order
   tensor (multi-dimensional data) of shape time x channel x trial. Then,
   the missing data can be efficiently recovered by applying a tensor
   completion method (TCM). However, there is not a unique way to organize
   channels and trials in a tensor, and different numbers of channels are
   available depending on the EEG setting used, which may affect the
   quality of the tensor completion results. The main goal of this paper is
   to evaluate the robustness of EEG completion methods with several
   designed parameters such as the ordering of channels and trials, the
   number of channels, and the amount of missing data. In this work, the
   results of completing missing data by several TCMs were compared. To
   emulate different scenarios of missing data, three different patterns of
   missing data were designed. Firstly, the amount of missing data on
   completion effects was analyzed, including the time lengths of missing
   data and the number of channels or trials affected by missing data.
   Secondly, the numerical stability of the completion methods was analyzed
   by shuffling the indices along channels or trials in the EEG data
   tensor. Finally, the way that the number of electrodes of EEG tensors
   influences completion effects was assessed by changing the number of
   channels. Among all the applied TCMs, the simultaneous tensor
   decomposition and completion (STDC) method achieves the best performance
   in providing stable results when the amount of missing data or the
   electrode number of EEG tensors is changed. In other words, STDC proves
   to be an excellent choice of TCM, since permutations of trials or
   channels have almost no influence on the complete results. The STDC
   method can efficiently complete the missing EEG signals. The designed
   simulations can be regarded as a procedure to validate whether or not a
   completion method is useful enough to complete EEG signals.}},

Title = {{Dynamic theta/beta ratio of clinical EEG in Alzheimer's disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{359}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: EEG of a resting state in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients
   and healthy controls (HC) are analyzed to identify the characteristics
   of EEG in AD.
   New method: A dynamic box plot approach to the theta/beta ratio with
   various window durations is proposed to analyze EEG.
   Results: Spectral results during a resting state in AD patients
   demonstrate the effect of relatively greater power in the low-frequency
   bands (i.e. `slowing down' of the EEG). A significant difference is
   observed in the dynamic distribution of the theta/beta ratio in the AD
   and HC groups, which is related to the effect of `slowing down'. There
   is a more obvious visual separation between the theta/beta ratio results
   for the AD and HC groups with increasing window durations. Variability
   of the theta/beta ratio can be observed with shorter window durations
   with a dynamic functional box plot. This provides a better
   classification accuracy by using the dynamic theta/ beta ratio as a
   sensor to discriminate AD EEG from HC EEG by using the receiver
   operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under curve (AUC)
   with various window durations. Comparison with existing method(s): EEG
   spectral analysis and theta/beta ratio used to evaluate EEG typically
   rely on long time averaging.
   Conclusions: The dynamic box plot approach to the theta/beta ratio with
   various window durations provides the possibility of observing features
   of the EEG. The dynamic theta/beta ratio is a better sensor to
   discriminate AD EEG from HC EEG. Moreover, the reliability and accuracy
   of results can be increased by combining spectral analysis and the
   dynamic box plot approach to theta/beta ratio with various window
   durations.}},

   Determinant In Motor-Imagery BCI}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is one of the most
   frequently used and effective spatial filtering methods for extracting
   relevant features for use in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces
   (MI-BCIs). However, the inherent defect of the traditional CSP algorithm
   is that it is highly sensitive to potential outliers, which adversely
   affects its performance in practical applications. In this work, we
   propose a novel feature optimization and outlier detection method for
   the CSP algorithm. Specifically, we use the minimum covariance
   determinant (MCD) to detect and remove outliers in the dataset, then we
   use the Fisher score to evaluate and select features. In addition, in
   order to prevent the emergence of new outliers, we propose an iterative
   minimum covariance determinant (IMCD) algorithm. We evaluate our
   proposed algorithm in terms of iteration times, classification accuracy
   and feature distribution using two BCI competition datasets. The
   experimental results show that the average classification performance of
   our proposed method is 12\% and 22.9\% higher than that of the
   traditional CSP method in two datasets (p < 0.05), and our proposed
   method obtains better performance in comparison with other competing
   methods. The results show that our method improves the performance of
   MI-BCI systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, two new algorithms are presented that convert a given
   data tensor train into either a Tucker decomposition with orthogonal
   matrix factors or a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
   (MERA). The Tucker core tensor is never explicitly computed but stored
   as a tensor train instead, resulting in both computationally and storage
   efficient algorithms. Both the multilinear Tucker-ranks as well as the
   MERA-ranks are automatically determined by the algorithm for a given
   upper bound on the relative approximation error. In addition, an
   iterative algorithm with low computational complexity based on solving
   an orthogonal Procrustes problem is proposed for the first time to
   retrieve optimal rank-lowering disentangler tensors, which are a crucial
   component in the construction of a low-rank MERA. Numerical experiments
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms together with
   the potential storage benefit of a low-rank MERA over a tensor train.}},

Abstract = {{The Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area (EPIA) and Global Brain
   Consortium endorsed recommendations on candidate electroencephalography
   (EEG) measures for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. The Panel
   reviewed the field literature. As most consistent findings, AD patients

   frequency, power, and ``interrelatedness{''} at posterior alpha (8-12
   Hz) and widespread delta (< 4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms in relation
   to disease progression and interventions. The following consensus
   statements were subscribed: (1) Standardization of instructions to
   patients, resting state EEG (rsEEG) recording methods, and selection of
   artifact-free rsEEG periods are needed; (2) power density and
   ``interrelatedness{''} rsEEG measures (e.g., directed transfer function,
   phase lag index, linear lagged connectivity, etc.) at delta, theta, and
   alpha frequency bands may be use for stratification of AD patients and
   monitoring of disease progression and intervention; and (3)
   international multisectoral initiatives are mandatory for regulatory
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) generally has a worse
   accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) than the visual-based BCI.
   It may be due to the fact that human beings have a relatively poor
   tactile perception. This study investigated the influence of visual
   attention on the performance of a tactile P300 BCI. We designed our
   paradigms based on a novel cheeks-stim paradigm which attached the
   stimulators on the subject's cheeks. Two paradigms were designed as
   follows: a paradigm with no visual attention and another paradigm with
   visual attention to the target position. Eleven subjects were invited to
   perform the two paradigms. We also recorded and analyzed the eyeball
   movement data during the paradigm with visual attention to explore
   whether the eyeball movement would have an effect on the BCI
   classification. The average online accuracy was 89.09\% for the paradigm
   with visual attention, which was significantly higher than that of the
   paradigm with no visual attention (70.45\%). Significant difference in
   ITR was also found between the two paradigms (p < 0.05). The results
   demonstrated that visual attention was an effective method to improve
   the performance of tactile P300 BCI. Our findings suggested that it may
   be feasible to complete an efficient tactile BCI system by adding visual
   attention.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal rank selection is an important issue in tensor decomposition
   problems, especially for Tensor Train (TT) and Tensor Ring (TR) (also
   known as Tensor Chain) decompositions. In this paper, a new rank
   selection method for TR decomposition has been proposed for
   automatically finding near-optimal TR ranks, which result in a lower
   storage cost, especially for tensors with inexact TT or TR structures.
   In many of the existing approaches, TR ranks are determined in advance
   or by using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD). There are
   also other approaches for selecting TR ranks adaptively. In our
   approach, the TR ranks are not determined in advance, but are increased
   gradually in each iteration until the model achieves a desired
   approximation accuracy. For this purpose, in each iteration, the
   sensitivity of the approximation error to each of the core tensors is
   measured and the core tensors with the highest sensitivity measures are
   selected and their sizes are increased. Simulation results confirmed
   that the proposed approach reduces the storage cost considerably and
   allows us to find optimal model in TR format, while preserving the
   desired accuracy of the approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The stimulus color of P300-BCI systems has been successfully
   modified. However, the effects of different color combinations have not
   been widely investigated. In this study, we designed new stimulus
   patterns to evaluate the influence of color modulation on the BCI
   performance and waveforms of the evoked related potential (ERP).Methods
   Comparison was performed for three new stimulus patterns consisting of
   red face and colored block-shape, namely, red face with a white
   rectangle (RFW), red face with a blue rectangle (RFB), and red face with
   a red rectangle (RFR). Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was
   used to construct the individual classifier model. Repeated-measures
   ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were applied for statistical analysis.
   Results The RFW pattern obtained the highest average online accuracy
   with 96.94\%, and those of RFR and RFB patterns were 93.61\% and of
   92.22\% respectively. Significant differences in online accuracy and
   information transfer rate (ITR) were found between RFW and RFR patterns
   (p < 0.05). Conclusion Compared with RFR and RFB patterns, RFW yielded
   the best performance in P300-BCI. These new stimulus patterns with
   different color combinations have considerable importance to BCI
   applications and user-friendliness.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile perception, the primary sensing channel of the tactile
   brain-computer interface (BCI), is a complicated process. Skin friction
   plays a vital role in tactile perception. This study aimed to examine
   the effects of skin friction on tactile P300 BCI performance. Two kinds
   of oddball paradigms were designed, silk-stim paradigm (SSP) and
   linen-stim paradigm (LSP), in which silk and linen were wrapped on
   target vibration motors, respectively. In both paradigms, the
   disturbance vibrators were wrapped in cotton. The experimental results
   showed that LSP could induce stronger event-related potentials (ERPs)
   and achieved a higher classification accuracy and information transfer
   rate (ITR) compared with SSP. The findings indicate that high skin
   friction can achieve high performance in tactile BCI. This work provides
   a novel research direction and constitutes a viable basis for the future
   tactile P300 BCI, which may benefit patients with visual impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Big data analysis has become a crucial part of new emerging technologies
   such as the internet of things, cyber-physical analysis, deep learning,
   anomaly detection, etc. Among many other techniques, dimensionality
   reduction plays a key role in such analyses and facilitates feature
   selection and feature extraction. Randomized algorithms are efficient
   tools for handling big data tensors. They accelerate decomposing
   large-scale data tensors by reducing the computational complexity of
   deterministic algorithms and the communication among different levels of
   memory hierarchy, which is the main bottleneck in modern computing
   environments and architectures. In this article, we review recent
   advances in randomization for computation of Tucker decomposition and
   Higher Order SVD (HOSVD). We discuss random projection and sampling
   approaches, single-pass and multi-pass randomized algorithms and how to
   utilize them in the computation of the Tucker decomposition and the
   HOSVD. Simulations on synthetic and real datasets are provided to
   compare the performance of some of best and most promising algorithms.}},

   Classification}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Pages = {{699-707}},
Abstract = {{The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is the most popular spatial
   filtering method applied to extract electroencephalogram (EEG) features
   for motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The
   effectiveness of the CSP algorithm depends on optimal selection of the
   frequency band and time window from the EEG. Many algorithms have been
   designed to optimize frequency band selection for CSP, while few
   algorithms seek to optimize the time window. This study proposes a novel
   framework, termed common time-frequency-spatial patterns (CTFSP), to
   extract sparse CSP features from multi-band filtered EEG data in
   multiple time windows. Specifically, the whole MI period is first
   segmented into multiple subseries using a sliding time window approach.
   Then, sparse CSP features are extracted from multiple frequency bands in
   each time window. Finally, multiple support vector machine (SVM)
   classifiers with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel are trained to
   identify the MI tasks and the voting result of these classifiers
   determines the final output of the BCI. This study applies the proposed
   CTFSP algorithm to three public EEG datasets (BCI competition III
   dataset IVa, BCI competition III dataset IIIa, and BCI competition IV
   dataset 1) to validate its effectiveness, compared against several other
   state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for improving the
   performance of MI-BCI systems.}},

Title = {{WLnet: Towards an Approach for Robust Workload Estimation Based on
   Shallow Neural Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{3165-3173}},
Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technology used for the
   human brain-computer interface. One of its important applications is the
   evaluation of the mental state of an individual, such as workload
   estimation. In previous works, common spatial pattern feature extraction
   methods have been proposed for the EEG-based workload detection.
   Recently, several novel methods were introduced to detect EEG pattern
   workloads. However, it is still unknown which one of these methods is
   the one that offers the best performance for the workload EEG pattern
   feature detection. In this article, four methods were used to extract
   workload EEG features: (a) common spatial pattern feature extraction;
   (b) temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern feature
   extraction; (c) EEGnet; and (d) the new proposed shallow convolutional
   neural network for workload estimation (WLnet). The classification
   accuracy of these four methods was compared. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed WLnet achieved the best detection accuracy
   in both stress and non-stress conditions. We believe that the proposed
   methods may be relevant to real-life applications of mental workload
   estimation.}},

Title = {{BCI-Based Rehabilitation on the Stroke in Sequela Stage}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background. Stroke is the leading cause of serious and long-term
   disability worldwide. Survivors may recover some motor functions after
   rehabilitation therapy. However, many stroke patients missed the best
   time period for recovery and entered into the sequela stage of chronic
   stroke. Method. Studies have shown that motor imagery- (MI-) based
   brain-computer interface (BCI) has a positive effect on poststroke
   rehabilitation. This study used both virtual limbs and functional
   electrical stimulation (FES) as feedback to provide patients with a
   closed-loop sensorimotor integration for motor rehabilitation. An
   MI-based BCI system acquired, analyzed, and classified motor attempts
   from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The FES system would be
   activated if the BCI detected that the user was imagining wrist
   dorsiflexion on the instructed side of the body. Sixteen stroke patients
   in the sequela stage were randomly assigned to a BCI group and a control
   group. All of them participated in rehabilitation training for four
   weeks and were assessed by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of motor
   function. Results. The average improvement score of the BCI group was
   3.5, which was higher than that of the control group (0.9). The active
   EEG patterns of the four patients in the BCI group whose FMA scores
   increased gradually became centralized and shifted to sensorimotor areas
   and premotor areas throughout the study. Conclusions. Study results
   showed evidence that patients in the BCI group achieved larger
   functional improvements than those in the control group and that the
   BCI-FES system is effective in restoring motor function to upper
   extremities in stroke patients. This study provides a more autonomous
   approach than traditional treatments used in stroke rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the inefficiency of gradient-based iterative ways in network
   training, randomization-based neural networks usually offer
   non-iterative closed form solutions. The random vector functional link
   (RVFL) and extreme learning machine (ELM) are two popular randomized
   networks which provide us unified frameworks for both regression and
   multi-class classification. Currently, existing studies on RVFL and ELM
   focused mainly on supervised tasks even though we usually have only a
   small number of labeled samples but a large number of unlabeled samples.
   Therefore, it is necessary to make both models appropriately utilize
   both labeled and unlabeled samples; that is, we should develop their
   semi-supervised extensions. In this paper, we propose a joint
   optimization framework to semi-supervised RVFL and ELM networks. In the
   formulated JOSRVFL (jointly optimized semi-supervised RVFL) and JOSELM,
   the output weight matrix and the label indicator matrix of the unlabeled
   samples can be jointly optimized in an iterative manner. We provide a
   novel approach to optimize the JOSRVFL and JOSELM objective functions.
   Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets and
   Electroencephalography-based emotion recognition tasks showed the
   excellent performance of the proposed JOSRVFL and JOSELM models.
   Moreover, because the direct input-output connections help to regularize
   the randomization, JOSRVFL could obtain superior performance to JOSELM
   in most cases. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Decompositions of tensors into factor matrices, which interact through a
   core tensor, have found numerous applications in signal processing and
   machine learning. A more general tensor model that represents data as an
   ordered network of subtensors of order-2 or order-3 has, so far, not
   been widely considered in these fields, although this so-called tensor
   network (TN) decomposition has been long studied in quantum physics and
   scientific computing. In this article, we present novel algorithms and
   applications of TN decompositions, with a particular focus on the tensor
   train (TT) decomposition and its variants. The novel algorithms
   developed for the TT decomposition update, in an alternating way, one or
   several core tensors at each iteration and exhibit enhanced mathematical
   tractability and scalability for large-scale data tensors. For rigor,
   the cases of the given ranks, given approximation error, and the given
   error bound are all considered. The proposed algorithms provide
   well-balanced TT-decompositions and are tested in the classic paradigms
   of blind source separation from a single mixture, denoising, and feature
   extraction, achieving superior performance over the widely used
   truncated algorithms for TT decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies made progress in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) using electroencephalography (EEG) without considering EEG
   connectivity. To fill this gap, we explored significant differences
   between early AD patients and controls based on frequency domain and
   spatial properties using functional connectivity in mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) and mild AD datasets. Four global metrics, network
   resilience, connection-level metrics and node versatility were used to
   distinguish between controls and patients. The results show that the
   main frequency bands that are different between MCI patients and
   controls are the theta and low alpha bands, and the differently affected
   brain areas are the frontal, left temporal and parietal areas. Compared
   to MCI patients, in patients with mild AD, the main frequency bands that
   are different are the low and high alpha bands, and the main differently
   affected brain region is a larger right temporal area. Four LOFC bands
   were used as input to train the ResNet-18 model. For the MCI dataset,
   the average accuracy of 20 runs was 93.42\% and the best accuracy was
   98.33\%, while for the mild AD dataset, the average accuracy was 98.54\%
   and the best accuracy was 100\%. To determine the timing of early
   treatment and discovering the susceptible patients, and to slow the
   progression of the disease, we assume that the occurrence of MCI and
   mild AD and their progression to more serious AD and dementia could be
   inferred by analyzing the topological structure of the brain network
   generated by EEG. Our findings provide a novel solution for
   connectome-based biomarker analysis to improve personalized medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of motor imagery (MI) based Brain-computer interfacing
   (BCI) is easily affected by noise and redundant information that exists
   in the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To solve this problem,
   many temporal and spatial feature based channel selection methods have
   been proposed. However, temporal and spatial features do not accurately
   reflect changes in the power of the oscillatory EEG. Thus, spectral
   features of MI-related EEG signals may be useful for channel selection.
   Bispectrum analysis is a technique developed for extracting non-linear
   and non-Gaussian information from non-linear and non-Gaussian signals.
   The features extracted from bispectrum analysis can provide frequency
   domain information about the EEG. Therefore, in this study, we propose a
   bispectrum-based channel selection (BCS) method for MI-based BCI. The
   proposed method uses the sum of logarithmic amplitudes (SLA) and the
   first order spectral moment (FOSM) features extracted from bispectrum
   analysis to select EEG channels without redundant information. Three
   public BCI competition datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 1, BCI
   competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset IIIa) were
   used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results
   indicate that our BCS method outperforms use of all channels (83.8\% vs
   69.4\%, 86.3\% vs 82.9\% and 77.8\% vs 68.2\%, respectively).
   Furthermore, compared to the other state-of-the-art methods, our BCS
   method also can achieve significantly better classification accuracies
   for MI-based BCI (Wilcoxon signed test, p < 0.05).}},

   emotion categories based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The
   results showed that (1) ERP was significantly different among four
   emotion categories (i.e., anger, disgust, neutral, and happy), but there
   was no significant difference for ERP in the comparison of rating orders
   (the order of rating actions of the paired participants); (2) the
   intra-brain phase lag index (PLI) was higher than the inter-brain PLI
   but its number of connections exhibiting significant difference was less
   in all typical frequency bands (from delta to gamma); (3) the emotion
   classification accuracy of inter-PLI-Conv outperformed that of
   intra-PLI-Conv for all cases of using each frequency band (five
   frequency bands totally). In particular, the classification accuracies
   averaged across all participants in the alpha band were 65.55\% and
   50.77\% (much higher than the chance level) for the inter-PLI-Conv and
   intra-PLI-Conv, respectively. According to our results, the emotion
   category of happiness can be classified with a higher performance
   compared to the other categories.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. The Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on Solar
   Orbiter is a hard X-ray imaging spectrometer, which covers the energy
   range from 4 to 150 keV. STIX observes hard X-ray bremsstrahlung
   emissions from solar flares and therefore provides diagnostics of the
   hottest (?10 MK) flare plasma while quantifying the location, spectrum,
   and energy content of flare-accelerated nonthermal electrons.Methods. To
   accomplish this, STIX applies an indirect bigrid Fourier imaging
   technique using a set of tungsten grids (at pitches from 0.038 to 1 mm)
   in front of 32 coarsely pixelated CdTe detectors to provide information
   on angular scales from 7 to 180 arcsec with 1 keV energy resolution (at
   6 keV). The imaging concept of STIX has intrinsically low telemetry and
   it is therefore well-suited to the limited resources available to the
   Solar Orbiter payload. To further reduce the downlinked data volume,
   STIX data are binned on board into 32 selectable energy bins and
   dynamically-adjusted time bins with a typical duration of 1 s during
   flares.Results. Through hard X-ray diagnostics, STIX provides critical
   information for understanding the acceleration of electrons at the Sun
   and their transport into interplanetary space and for determining the
   magnetic connection of Solar Orbiter back to the Sun. In this way, STIX
   serves to link Solar Orbiter's remote and in-situ measurements.}},

   ellipsoids is proposed. This is achieved by splitting the QP problem
   into two optimisation sub-problems, (1) quadratic programming over a
   sphere and (2) orthogonal projection. Next, an augmented-Lagrangian
   algorithm is developed for this multiple constraint optimisation.
   Benefitting from the fact that the QP over a single sphere can be solved
   in a closed form by solving a secular equation, we derive a tighter
   bound of the minimiser of the secular equation. We also propose to
   generate a new positive semidefinite matrix with a low condition number
   from the matrices in the quadratic constraint, which is shown to improve
   convergence of the proposed augmented-Lagrangian algorithm. Finally,
   applications of the quadratically constrained QP to bounded linear
   regression and tensor decomposition paradigms are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is a convenient and intuitive
   tool for tensor factorization; however, for higher order tensors, it
   often exhibits high computational cost and permutation of tensor
   entries, and these undesirable effects grow exponentially with the
   tensor order. Prior compression of tensor in-hand can reduce the
   computational cost of CPD, but this is only applicable when the rank R
   of the decomposition does not exceed the tensor dimensions. To resolve
   these issues, we present a novel method for CPD of higher order tensors,
   which rests upon a simple tensor network of representative
   interconnected core tensors of orders not higher than 3. For rigor, we
   develop an exact conversion scheme from the core tensors to the factor
   matrices in CPD and an iterative algorithm of low complexity to estimate
   these factor matrices for the inexact case. Comprehensive simulations
   over a variety of scenarios support the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Presurgical investigations for categorizing focal patterns are crucial,
   leading to localization and surgical removal of the epileptic focus.
   This paper presents a machine learning approach using information
   theoretic features extracted from high-frequency subbands to detect the
   epileptic focus from interictal intracranial electroencephalogram
   (iEEG). It is known that high-frequency subbands (>80Hz) include
   important biomarkers such as high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) for
   identifying epileptic focus commonly referred to as the seizure onset
   zone (SOZ). In this analysis, the multi-channel interictal iEEG signals
   were splitted into segments and each segment was decomposed into
   multiple high-frequency subbands. The different types of entropy were
   calculated for each of the subbands and the sparse linear discriminant
   analysis (sLDA) was applied to select the prominent entropy features.
   Due to the imbalance of SOZ and non-SOZ channels in iEEG data, the use
   of machine learning techniques is always tricky. To deal with the
   imbalanced learning problem, an adaptive synthetic oversampling approach
   (ADASYN) with radial basis function kernel-based SVM was used to detect
   the focal segments. Finally, the epileptic focus was identified based on
   detection of focal segments on SOZ and non-SOZ channels. Eight patients
   were examined to observe the efficiency of the automatic detector. The
   experimental results and statistical tests indicate that the proposed
   automatic detector can identify the epileptic focus accurately and
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive motor dissociation describes a subset of patients with
   disorders of consciousness who show neuroimaging evidence of
   consciousness but no detectable command-following behaviours. Although
   essential for family counselling, decision-making, and the design of
   rehabilitation programmes, the prognosis for patients with cognitive
   motor dissociation remains under-investigated. The current study
   included 78 patients with disorders of consciousness who showed no
   detectable command-following behaviours. These patients included 45
   patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and 33 patients in a
   minimally conscious state, as diagnosed using the Coma Recovery
   Scale-Revised. Each patient underwent an EEG-based brain-computer
   interface experiment, in which he or she was instructed to perform an
   item-selection task (i.e. select a photograph or a number from two
   candidates). Patients who achieved statistically significant
   brain-computer interface accuracies were identified as cognitive motor
   dissociation. Two evaluations using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, one
   before the experiment and the other 3 months later, were carried out to
   measure the patients' behavioural improvements. Among the 78 patients
   with disorders of consciousness, our results showed that within the
   unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patient group, 15 of 18 patients with
   cognitive motor dissociation (83.33\%) regained consciousness, while
   only five of the other 27 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients
   without significant brain-computer interface accuracies (18.52\%)
   regained consciousness. Furthermore, within the minimally conscious
   state patient group, 14 of 16 patients with cognitive motor dissociation
   (87.5\%) showed improvements in their Coma Recovery Scale-Revised
   scores, whereas only four of the other 17 minimally conscious state
   patients without significant brain-computer interface accuracies
   (23.53\%) had improved Coma Recovery Scale-Revised scores. Our results
   suggest that patients with cognitive motor dissociation have a better
   outcome than other patients. Our findings extend current knowledge of
   the prognosis for patients with cognitive motor dissociation and have
   important implications for brain-computer interface-based clinical
   diagnosis and prognosis for patients with disorders of consciousness.}},

Abstract = {{Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been widely used for frequency
   recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based
   brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, linear CCA-based methods may
   be insufficient given the complexity of EEG signals. A nonlinear feature
   extraction method based on deep multiset CCA (DMCCA) is proposed for
   SSVEP recognition to fully utilize the real EEG and constructed
   sine-cosine signals. In DMCCA, neural networks are trained to learn the
   nonlinear representations of multiple sets of EEG signals at the same
   frequency by maximizing the overall correlation within the
   representations and reference signals. Therefore, reference signals are
   augmented with the extracted features for frequency recognition.
   Finally, the proposed method is evaluated using SSVEP signals collected
   from 10 subjects. DMCCA-based method outperforms others in terms of
   classification accuracy compared with CCA- and multiset CCA-based
   methods. The proposed DMCCA-based method has substantial potential for
   improving the recognition performance of SSVEP signals. (C) 2019

Title = {{Effects of Visual Attention on Tactile P300 BCI}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Tactile P300 brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be
   manipulated by users who only need to focus their attention on a
   single-target stimulus within a stream of tactile stimuli. To date, a
   multitude of tactile P300 BCIs have been proposed. In this study, our
   main purpose is to explore and investigate the effects of visual
   attention on a tactile P300 BCI. Approach. We designed a conventional
   tactile P300 BCI where vibration stimuli were provided by five
   stimulators and two of them were fixed on target locations on the
   participant's left and right wrists. Two conditions (one condition with
   visual attention and the other condition without visual attention) were
   tested by eleven healthy participants. Main Results. Our results showed
   that, when participants visually attended to the location of target
   stimulus, significantly higher classification accuracies and information
   transfer rates were obtained (both for p<0.05). Furthermore,
   participants reported that visually attending to the stimulus made it
   easier to identify the target stimulus in random sequences of vibration
   stimuli. Significance. These findings suggest that visual attention has
   positive effects on both tactile P300 BCI performance and
   user-evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Neurons selective for faces exist in humans and monkeys. However,
   characteristics of face cell receptive fields are poorly understood. In
   this theoretical study, we explore the effects of complexity, defined as
   algorithmic information (Kolmogorov complexity) and logical depth, on
   possible ways that face cells may be organized. We use tensor
   decompositions to decompose faces into a set of components, called
   tensorfaces, and their associated weights, which can be interpreted as
   model face cells and their firing rates. These tensorfaces form a
   high-dimensional representation space in which each tensorface forms an
   axis of the space. A distinctive feature of the decomposition algorithm
   is the ability to specify tensorface complexity. We found that
   low-complexity tensorfaces have blob-like appearances crudely
   approximating faces, while high-complexity tensorfaces appear clearly
   face-like. Low-complexity tensorfaces require a larger population to
   reach a criterion face reconstruction error than medium- or
   high-complexity tensorfaces, and thus are inefficient by that criterion.
   Low-complexity tensorfaces, however, generalize better when representing
   statistically novel faces, which are faces falling beyond the
   distribution of face description parameters found in the tensorface
   training set. The degree to which face representations are parts based
   or global forms a continuum as a function of tensorface complexity, with
   low and medium tensorfaces being more parts based. Given the
   computational load imposed in creating high-complexity face cells (in
   the form of algorithmic information and logical depth) and in the
   absence of a compelling advantage to using high-complexity cells, we
   suggest face representations consist of a mixture of low- and
   medium-complexity face cells.}},

Title = {{Comparison of the ERP-Based BCI Performance Among Chromatic (RGB)
   Semitransparent Face Patterns}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Objective Previous studies have shown that combing with color properties
   may be used as part of the display presented to BCI users in order to
   improve performance. Build on this, we explored the effects of
   combinations of face stimuli with three primary colors (RGB) on BCI
   performance which is assessed by classification accuracy and information
   transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, we analyzed the waveforms of three
   patterns. Methods We compared three patterns in which semitransparent
   face is overlaid three primary colors as stimuli: red semitransparent
   face (RSF), green semitransparent face (GSF), and blue semitransparent
   face (BSF). Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to
   construct the individual classifier model. In addition, a
   Repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were chosen
   for statistical analysis. Results The results indicated that the RSF
   pattern achieved the highest online averaged accuracy with 93.89\%,
   followed by the GSF pattern with 87.78\%, while the lowest performance
   was caused by the BSF pattern with an accuracy of 81.39\%. Furthermore,
   significant differences in classification accuracy and ITR were found
   between RSF and GSF (p < 0.05) and between RSF and BSF patterns (p <
   0.05). Conclusion The semitransparent faces colored red (RSF) pattern
   yielded the best performance of the three patterns. The proposed
   patterns based on ERP-BCI system have a clinically significant impact by
   increasing communication speed and accuracy of the P300-speller for
   patients with severe motor impairment.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999, the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN)
   published ``IFCN Guidelines for topographic and frequency analysis of
   EEGs and EPs{''} (Nuwer et al., 1999). Here a Workgroup of IFCN experts
   presents unanimous recommendations on the following procedures relevant
   for the topographic and frequency analysis of resting state EEGs
   (rsEEGs) in clinical research defined as neurophysiological experimental
   studies carried out in neurological and psychiatric patients: (1)
   recording of rsEEGs (environmental conditions and instructions to
   participants; montage of the EEG electrodes; recording settings); (2)
   digital storage of rsEEG and control data; (3) computerized
   visualization of rsEEGs and control data (identification of artifacts
   and neuropathological rsEEG waveforms); (4) extraction of
   ``synchronization{''} features based on frequency analysis (band-pass
   filtering and computation of rsEEG amplitude/power density spectrum);
   (5) extraction of ``connectivity{''} features based on frequency
   analysis (linear and nonlinear measures); (6) extraction of
   ``topographic{''} features (topographic mapping; cortical source
   mapping; estimation of scalp current density and dura surface potential;
   cortical connectivity mapping), and (7) statistical analysis and
   neurophysiological interpretation of those rsEEG features. As core
   outcomes, the IFCN Workgroup endorsed the use of the most promising
   ``synchronization{''} and ``connectivity{''} features for clinical
   research, carefully considering the limitations discussed in this paper.
   The Workgroup also encourages more experimental (i.e. simulation
   studies) and clinical research within international initiatives (i.e.,
   shared software platforms and databases) facing the open controversies
   about electrode montages and linear vs. nonlinear and electrode vs.
   source levels of those analyses. (C) 2019 International Federation of

Abstract = {{Electrophysiology provides a real-time readout of neural functions and
   network capability in different brain states, on temporal (fractions of
   milliseconds) and spatial (micro, meso, and macro) scales unmet by other
   methodologies. However, current international guidelines do not endorse
   the use of electroencephalographic (EEG)/magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
   biomarkers in clinical trials performed in patients with Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), despite a surge in recent validated evidence. This
   position paper of the ISTAART Electrophysiology Professional Interest
   Area endorses consolidated and translational electrophysiological
   techniques applied to both experimental animal models of AD and
   patients, to probe the effects of AD neuropathology (i.e., brain
   amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration) on neurophysiological
   mechanisms underpinning neural excitation/inhibition and
   neurotransmission as well as brain network dynamics, synchronization,
   and functional connectivity, reflecting thalamocortical and
   corticocortical residual capacity. Converging evidence shows
   relationships between abnormalities in EEG/MEG markers and cognitive
   deficits in groups of AD patients at different disease stages. The
   supporting evidence for the application of electrophysiology in AD
   clinical research as well as drug discovery pathways warrants an
   international initiative to include the use of EEG/MEG biomarkers in the
   main multicentric projects planned in AD patients, to produce conclusive
   findings challenging the present regulatory requirements and guidelines
   for AD studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{P300-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an additional
   communication channel for individuals with communication disabilities.
   In general, P300-based BCIs need to be trained, offline, for a
   considerable period of time, which causes users to become fatigued. This
   reduces the efficiency and performance of the system. In order to
   shorten calibration time and improve system performance, we introduce
   the concept of a generic model set. We used ERP data from 116
   participants to train the generic model set. The resulting set consists
   of ten models, which are trained by weighted linear discriminant
   analysis (WLDA). Twelve new participants were then invited to test the
   validity of the generic model set. The results demonstrated that all new
   participants matched the best generic model. The resulting mean
   classification accuracy equaled 80\% after online training, an accuracy
   that was broadly equivalent to the typical training model method.
   Moreover, the calibration time was shortened by 70.7\% of the
   calibration time of the typical model method. In other words, the best
   matching model method only took 81s to calibrate, while the typical
   model method took 276s. There were also significant differences in both
   accuracy and raw bit rate between the best and the worst matching model
   methods. We conclude that the strategy of combining the generic models
   with online training is easily accepted and achieves higher levels of
   user satisfaction (as measured by subjective reports). Thus, we provide
   a valuable new strategy for improving the performance of P300-based BCI.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring the sleep quality is important or even crucial for people who
   are engaged in dangerous jobs such as the high-speed train drivers.
   Since the scalp EEG data are generated by the neural activities of the
   brain cortex, it is collected from subjects with different hours of
   sleep time (4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours) to conduct sleep quality
   evaluation. To suppress the cross-subject variances of EEG data, in this
   paper, we propose a joint feature auto-weighting and semi-supervised
   classification model, termed GRLSR, which is formulated by introducing
   an auto-weighting variable into the least square regression to
   adaptively and quantitatively measure the importance of each dimension
   of the feature. Once the model is solved, besides the measurement
   results, we can use the auto-weighting variable to 1) analyze the
   importance of each frequency band in sleep quality expression and 2)
   identify the capacity of different channels connecting to the sleep
   effect. Therefore, the proposed GRLSR is a pure data-driven computing
   model for EEG-based cross-subject sleep quality evaluation. Experimental
   results show its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The adrenal gland is a frequent site of metastases in
   different types of cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the
   results of metastatic adrenalectomy in a single institution and to
   identify factors for survival.
   Material and methods: A retrospective, single-centre analysis of
   outcomes of 39 patients (22 male, 17 female) with adrenal metastases who
   underwent surgery within 14 years (20042017) was performed. The median
   age at the time of adrenal surgery was 64.8 years (range 49-79 years).
   Results: In our study group non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was the
   most frequent primary tumour type (15 pts), followed by renal cell
   carcinoma (RCC) (14 pts) and colon cancer (6 pts). Most of the
   metastases - 36 (92\%) - were metachronous (> 6 months). All synchronous
   metastases were NSCLC. The mean time from primary cancer to
   adrenalectomy was 42.3 months (range 1-176) and was statistically longer
   for RCC. In 3 patients (8\%) metastases were bilateral and both adrenal
   glands were removed. In all patients, surgery was limited to the adrenal
   gland, and no major complications of surgery were observed. The median
   overall survival after metastasectomy was 18 months (3-81) and was
   statistically longer for colon cancer - 29.5 months (p = 0.012). In
   patients who died, tumours were significantly bigger than in survivors,
   76.5 mm vs. 52.5 mm (p = 0.026).
   Conclusions: Surgery for adrenal metastasis is safe and indications for
   this procedure should be individualized. In selected patients, surgical
   removal of adrenal metastasis was associated with longer survival.}},

Journal = {{IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{810-814}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of time series reconstruction in a multiway
   delay embedded space using Tensor Train decomposition is addressed. A
   new algorithm has been developed in which an incomplete signal is first
   transformed to a Hankel matrix and in the next step to a higher order
   tensor using extended Multiway Delay embedded Transform. Then, the
   resulting higher order tensor is completed using low rank Tensor Train
   decomposition. Comparing to previous Hankelization approaches, in the
   proposed approach, blocks of elements are used for Hankelization instead
   of individual elements, which results in producing a higher order
   tensor. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and high
   performance of the proposed completion approach. Although in this paper
   we focus on single time series, our method can be straightforwardly
   extended to reconstruction of multivariate time series, color images and
   videos.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a novel approach for multiple time series
   forecasting. At first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is
   employed to represent time series as low-rank block Hankel tensors
   (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors are projected to compressed core
   tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At the same time, the
   generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is
   explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future samples.
   In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the unique
   advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and
   tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified
   framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block
   Hankel tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic
   correlations among multiple TS. which thus can improve the forecasting
   results, especially for multiple short time series. Experiments
   conducted on three public datasets and two industrial datasets verify
   that the proposed BHT-ARIMA effectively improves forecasting accuracy
   and reduces computational cost compared with the state-of-the-art
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Weighted canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition appears in a wide
   range of applications. A typical situation where the weighted
   decomposition is needed is when some tensor elements are unknown, and
   the task is to fill in the missing elements under the assumption that
   the tensor admits a low-rank model. The traditional methods for
   large-scale decomposition tasks are based on alternating least-squares
   methods or gradient methods. Second-order methods might have
   significantly better convergence, but so far they were used only on
   small tensors. The proposed Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt method enables to
   do second-order-based iterations even in large-scale decomposition
   problems, with or without weights. We show in simulations that the
   proposed technique can outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms
   in some scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a new way for the brain to
   interact with the outside world. One of the common BCI systems is the
   visual P300 speller. Previous studies have shown that faces can induce
   strong event-related potentials (ERPs) to achieve high classification
   accuracy and the block-shaped condition can obtain better performance by
   increasing the size of the highlighted surface. However, the effects of
   both blended factors have not yet been studied. Therefore, we proposed a
   red block-shaped face paradigm (RBFP) combining both block-shape and
   face. We compared the proposed paradigm with the traditional red face
   paradigm (RFP) to validate its feasibility and effectiveness. Results
   indicated that RBFP had better classification accuracy (95.27\% vs.
   91.116/0) and raw bit rate (R BR) (25.84 bit/min vs. 23.43 bit/min) than
   RFP, and could elicit particularly increased ERPs. Moreover, RBFP
   obtained a high degree of preference in the subjective assessment. In
   conclusion, the proposed paradigm combined the advantages of both types
   of stimuli to obtain a significant improvement in BCI performance, which
   was meaningful for future BCI studies.}},

   many applications. Many times, the true tensor rank is not known, or

   we introduce a notion of sensitivity of CP decomposition and suggest to

   a Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt CP decomposition algorithm which may serve

Abstract = {{Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior and has
   been widely used in electroencephalogram based brain-computer interfaces
   (BCIs). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MI-based
   BCI-feedback training in post-stroke rehabilitation. However, in the
   earliest stage of the training, calibration data typically contain
   insufficient discriminability, resulting in unreliable feedback, which
   may decrease subjects' motivation and even hinder their training. To
   improve the performance in the early stages of MI training, a novel
   hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and P300 is proposed in this study. In
   this paradigm, subjects are instructed to imagine writing the Chinese
   character following the flash order of the desired Chinese character
   displayed on the screen. The event-related
   desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) phenomenon is produced with
   writing based on one's imagination. Simultaneously, the P300 potential
   is evoked by the flash of each stroke. Moreover, a fusion method of P300
   and MI classification is proposed, in which unreliable P300
   classifications are corrected by reliable MI classifications. Twelve
   healthy naive MI subjects participated in this study. Results
   demonstrated that the proposed hybrid BCI paradigm yielded significantly
   better performance than the single-modality BCI paradigm. The
   recognition accuracy of the fusion method is significantly higher than
   that of P300 (p < 0.05) and MI (p < 0.01). Moreover, the training data
   size can be reduced through fusion of these two modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-channel EEG data are usually necessary for spatial pattern
   identification in motor imagery (MI)-based brain computer interfaces
   (BCIs). To some extent, signals from some channels containing redundant
   information and noise may degrade BCI performance. We assume that the
   channels related to MI should contain common information when
   participants are executing the MI tasks. Based on this hypothesis, a
   correlation-based channel selection (CCS) method is proposed to select
   the channels that contained more correlated information in this study.
   The aim is to improve the classification performance of MI-based BCIs.
   Furthermore, a novel regularized common spatial pattern (RCSP) method is
   used to extract effective features. Finally, a support vector machine
   (SVM) classifier with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is trained
   to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is
   implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV dataset1,
   BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset Ma) to
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show
   that the CCS algorithm obtained superior classification accuracy (78\%
   versus 56.4\% for dataset1, 86.6\% versus 76.5\% for dataset 2 and
   91.3\% versus 85.1\% for dataset 3) compared to the algorithm using all
   channels (AC), when CSP is used to extract the features. Furthermore,
   RCSP could further improve the classification accuracy (81.6\% for
   datasetl, 87.4\% for dataset2 and 91.9\% for dataset 3), when CCS is
   used to select the channels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Common spatial pattern (CSP)-based spatial filtering has been most
   popularly applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) feature extraction for
   motor imagery (MI) classification in brain-computer interface (BCI)
   application. The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the
   frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous
   algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP,
   most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely
   to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when
   the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately
   detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally
   constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous
   optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost
   classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific
   signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a
   set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals
   is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window
   approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and
   time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP
   features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector
   machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to
   accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented
   on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI
   Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to
   validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other
   competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged
   accuracies are 88.5\%, 83.3\%, and 84.3\% for the three datasets,
   respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the
   proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement
   of MI-based BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{Event-related potentials (ERPs) especially P300 are popular effective
   features for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on
   electroencephalography (EEG). Traditional ERP-based BCI systems may
   perform poorly for small training samples, i.e. the undersampling
   problem. In this study, the ERP classification problem was investigated,
   in particular, the ERP classification in the high-dimensional setting
   with the number of features larger than the number of samples was
   studied. A flexible group sparse discriminative analysis algorithm based
   on Moreau-Yosida regularization was proposed for alleviating the
   undersampling problem. An optimization problem with the group sparse
   criterion was presented, and the optimal solution was proposed by using
   the regularized optimal scoring method. During the alternating iteration
   procedure, the feature selection and classification were performed
   simultaneously. Two P300-based BCI datasets were used to evaluate our
   proposed new method and compare it with existing standard methods. The
   experimental results indicated that the features extracted via our
   proposed method are efficient and provide an overall better P300
   classification accuracy compared with several state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Stimulus visual patterns, such as size, content, color,
   luminosity, and interval, play key roles for brain-computer interface
   (BCI) performance. However, the three primary colors to be intercompared
   as a single variable or factor on the same platform are poorly studied.
   In this work, we configured the visual stimulus patterns with red,
   green, and blue operating on a newly designed layout of the flash
   pattern of BCI to study the waveforms and performance of the evoked
   related potential (ERP).
   Approach: Twelve subjects participated in our experiment, and each
   subject was required to finish three different color sub-experiments.
   Four blocks of the interface were presented along the edge of the
   screen, and the other four were assembled in the center, aiming to
   investigate the problem of adjacency distraction. Repeated-measures
   ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were applied for statistical analysis.
   Main results: The averaged online accuracy was 98.44\% for the red
   paradigm, higher than 92.71\% for the green paradigm, and 93.23\% for
   the blue paradigm. Furthermore, significant differences in online
   accuracy (p < 0.05) and information transfer rate (p < 0.05) were found
   between the red and green paradigms.
   Significance: The red stimulus paradigm yielded the best performance.
   The proposed design of ERP-based BCI was practical and effective for
   many potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) signals may provide abundant information
   reflecting the developmental changes in brain status. It usually takes a
   long time to finally judge whether a brain is dead, so an effective
   pre-test of brain states method is needed. In this paper, we present a
   hybrid processing pipeline to differentiate brain death and coma
   patients based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of power spectral
   density, complexity features, and feature fusion for group analysis. In
   addition, time-varying power spectrum and complexity were observed based
   on the analysis of individual patients, which can be used to monitor the
   change of brain status over time. Results showed three major differences
   between brain death and coma groups of EEG signal: slowing, increased
   complexity, and the improvement on classification accuracy with feature
   fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme for joint
   general analysis and time-varying state monitoring. Delta-band relative
   power spectrum density and permutation entropy could effectively be
   regarded as potential features of discrimination analysis on brain death
   and coma patients.}},

Abstract = {{In CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition, degeneracy often occurs in
   some difficult scenarios, especially, when the rank exceeds the tensor
   dimension, or when the loading components are highly collinear in
   several or all modes, or when CPD does not have an optimal solution. In
   such cases, norms of some rank-1 tensors become significantly large and
   cancel each other. This makes algorithms getting stuck in local minima
   while running a huge number of iterations does not improve the
   decomposition. In this paper, we propose an error preservation
   correction method to deal with such problem. Our aim is to seek an
   alternative tensor, which preserves the approximation error, but norms
   of rank-1 tensor components of the new tensor are minimized. Alternating
   and all-at-once correction algorithms have been developed for the
   problem. In addition, we propose a novel CPD with a bound constraint on
   the norm of the rank-one tensors. The method can be useful for
   decomposing tensors that cannot be performed by traditional algorithms.
   Finally, we demonstrate an application of the proposed method in image
   denoising and decomposition of the weight tensors in convolutional
   neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{A potential limitation of a motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer
   interface (BCI) is that it usually requires a relatively long time to
   record sufficient electroencephalogram (EEG) data for robust classifier
   training. The calibration burden during data acquisition phase will most
   probably cause a subject to be reluctant to use a BCI system. To
   alleviate this issue, we propose a novel sparse group representation
   model (SGRM) for improving the efficiency of MI-based BCI by exploiting
   the intersubject information. Specifically, preceded by feature
   extraction using common spatial pattern, a composite dictionary matrix
   is constructed with training samples from both the target subject and
   other subjects. By explicitly exploiting within-group sparse and
   group-wise sparse constraints, the most compact representation of a test
   sample of the target subject is then estimated as a linear combination
   of columns in the dictionary matrix. Classification is implemented by
   calculating the classspecific representation residual based on the
   significant training samples corresponding to the nonzero representation
   coefficients. Accordingly, the proposed SGRM method effectively reduces
   the required training samples from the target subject due to auxiliary
   data available from other subjects. With two public EEG data sets,
   extensive experimental comparisons are carried out between SGRM and
   other stateof-the-art approaches. Superior classification performance of
   our method using 40 trials of the target subject for model calibration
   (Averaged accuracy = 78.2\%, Kappa = 0.57 and Averaged accuracy =
   77.7\%, Kappa = 0.55 for the two data sets, respectively) indicates its
   promising potential for improving the practicality of MI-based BCI.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a multimodal emotion recognition framework
   called EmotionMeter that combines brain waves and eye movements. To
   increase the feasibility and wearability of EmotionMeter in real-world
   applications, we design a six-electrode placement above the ears to
   collect electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We combine EEG and eye
   movements for integrating the internal cognitive states and external
   subconscious behaviors of users to improve the recognition accuracy of
   EmotionMeter. The experimental results demonstrate that modality fusion
   with multimodal deep neural networks can significantly enhance the
   performance compared with a single modality, and the best mean accuracy
   of 85.11\% is achieved for four emotions (happy, sad, fear, and
   neutral). We explore the complementary characteristics of EEG and eye
   movements for their representational capacities and identify that EEG
   has the advantage of classifying happy emotion, whereas eye movements
   outperform EEG in recognizing fear emotion. To investigate the stability
   of EmotionMeter over time, each subject performs the experiments three
   times on different days. EmotionMeter obtains a mean recognition
   accuracy of 72.39\% across sessions with the six-electrode EEG and eye
   movement features. These experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of EmotionMeter within and between sessions.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems can allow their users to
   communicate with the external world by recognizing intention directly
   from their brain activity without the assistance of the peripheral motor
   nervous system. The P300-speller is one of the most widely used visual
   BCI applications. In previous studies, a flip stimulus (rotating the
   background area of the character) that was based on apparent motion,
   suffered from less refractory effects. However, its performance was not
   improved significantly. In addition, a presentation paradigm that used a
   ``zooming{''} action (changing the size of the symbol) has been shown to
   evoke relatively higher P300 amplitudes and obtain a better BCI
   performance. To extend this method of stimuli presentation within a BCI
   and, consequently, to improve BCI performance, we present a new paradigm
   combining both the flip stimulus with a zooming action. This new
   presentation modality allowed BCI users to focus their attention more
   easily. We investigated whether such an action could combine the
   advantages of both types of stimuli presentation to bring a significant
   improvement in performance compared to the conventional flip stimulus.
   The experimental results showed that the proposed paradigm could obtain
   significantly higher classification accuracies and bit rates than the
   conventional flip paradigm (p<0.01).}},

Abstract = {{Reliability analysis plays significant role in development of space
   applications, where today, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are
   employed very often, especially because of the fact that they may hold
   implementation of custom fault mitigation techniques. While transient
   (soft) faults, caused by the space radiation, such as Single/Multiple
   Event Upsets (SEU/MEUs) or Single Event Transients (SETs) can be
   generated inside the FPGA or propagated from other circuits in digital
   system, the FPGA may implement redundancy (mainly hardware or time
   domain) to protect whole system from functional interrupt. Currently,
   space FPGA engineers face challenges both at design and verification
   stages of their applications. Common questions are related to selection
   of target FPGA, optimal combination of fault mitigation techniques to be
   implemented, estimated reliability for target radiation environment as
   well as finding reliability bottlenecks. Many previous works focused on
   analysis of fault propagation in terms of static and formal analysis,
   while the methods used to analyze real-life design examples are still
   basing on statistical analysis of fault injection effects. Both
   solutions have significant limitations. The authors of this paper
   propose novel approach to modelling of soft faults propagation effects
   by simulation in fuzzy logic domain that is compatible with commonly
   used FPGA design and verification process and provides good balance

Title = {{An Optimized Channel Selection Method Based on Multifrequency CSP-Rank
   for Motor Imagery-Based BCI System}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Background. Due to the redundant information contained in multichannel
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the classification accuracy of
   brain-computer interface (BCI) systems may deteriorate to a large
   extent. Channel selection methods can help to remove task-independent
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and hence improve the performance of
   BCI systems. However, in different frequency bands, brain areas
   associated with motor imagery are not exactly the same, which will
   result in the inability of traditional channel selection methods to
   extract effective EEG features. New Method. To address the above
   problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on common spatial
   pattern- (CSP-) rank channel selection for multifrequency band EEG
   (CSP-R-MF). It combines the multiband signal decomposition filtering and
   the CSP-rank channel selection methods to select significant channels,
   and then linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to calculate the
   classification accuracy. Results. The results showed that our proposed
   CSP-R-MF method could significantly improve the average classification
   accuracy compared with the CSP-rank channel selection method.}},

Title = {{The Value of Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy (SRS) in Patients with
   NETG1/G2 Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (p-NENs)}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR MEDICINE REVIEW}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{1-7}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas (p-NEN) are common
   gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). The aim of
   this retrospective study was to review the value of Somatostatin
   Receptor Scintigraphy (SRS) in initial detection of p-NEN, evaluation of
   tumour extent and as imaging follow-up after radical surgery in patients
   with confirmed well (NETG1) or moderately (NETG2) differentiated p-NEN
   based on pathological WHO 2017 classification.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall 281 patients with confirmed p-NEN were
   enrolled. The SRS was performed to evaluate primary p-NEN, to assess
   clinical stage of disease, based on current World Health Organization
   (WHO) classification and during clinical follow-up. A total of 829
   examinations were performed over time in these 281 patients using Tc-99m
   HYNICTOC. Images were acquired between 1-3 h after i.v. injection of
   radiotracer. Initially whole body WB-SPECT and then WB-SPECT/CT with
   standard iterative reconstruction were used.
   RESULTS: There were 159 patients with NETG1 (57\%) and 122 subjects with
   NETG2 (43\%). The female to male ratio was 1.1:1. In 68 patients (22\%)
   with NETG1/G2 eighty-seven SRSs (10\%) were performed to confirm initial
   diagnosis. SRS results were as follow: true positive (TP) = 84 (97\%),
   false negative (FN) = 3 (3\%), no true negative (TN) or false positive
   (FP) results of SRS examination (sensitivity of SRS per patient was
   96\%). In 198 subjects (66\%) SRS was used in evaluation and
   re-evaluation of the clinical stage. A total of 661 (80\%) examinations
   were carried out in these patients. There were TP = 514 (77\%), TN = 136
   (21\%), FN = 7 (1\%) and FP = 4 (1\%) results. The sensitivity and
   specificity per patient were: 96\% and 95\%. The sensitivity and
   specificity per study were: 98\% and 97\%. In 35 patients (12\%) SRS was
   used as imaging follow-up after radical surgery; there were overall 81
   examinations (10\%) performed. There were 76 (91\%) TN results of SRS
   examinations and in 4 patients we identified recurrence (TP). In total,
   which consists of initial diagnosis/staging and patient follow-up, the
   sensitivity of SRS was 96\% and specificity 97\% per patient and per
   study sensitivity and specificity was 98\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS using Tc-99m HYNICTOC acquired in WB-SPECT or
   WB-SPECT/CT techniques is an excellent imaging modality in detection of
   primary NETG1/G2 p-NEN. Our study confirms that SRS has high sensitivity
   and specificity, as a result has tremendous value as an examination
   method to assess clinical stage of disease and as an imaging follow-up
   after radical treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brainprint recognition was usually
   completed under a singular task, such as recognition based on
   visual-evoked potentials. This paper proposes a fast task-free
   brainprint recognition to break the restriction. We presume a
   task-related EEG can be divided into the background EEG (BEEG) and the
   residue EEG. Wherein, BEEG contains one's unique intrinsic brainprint,
   which was supposed to be a low-rank characteristic. To analyse more
   precisely, short time Fourier Transform (STFT) are exerted to expand
   time series EEG into time-frequency domain. Then, a Low-Rank Matrix
   Decomposition (LRMD)-based algorithm combined with maximum correntropy
   criterion (MCC) and rational quadratic kernel was designed to extract
   BEEG. Finally, through sparse representation, BEEG can be classified
   efficiently. The excellent performance under low rank and various time
   length scales indicates that our method does not rely on task types and
   provides a new direction for the application of brainprint recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an efficient model in
   learning parts-based data representation. Since the local geometrical
   structure can be effectively modeled by a nearest neighbor graph, the
   graph regularized NMF (GNMF) was proposed to make the learned
   representation more faithfully and better characterize the intrinsic
   structure of data. However, GNMF shares a similar paradigm with most of
   existing graph-based learning models which perform learning tasks on a
   fixed input graph. In this paper, we propose a new Flexible NMF model
   with adaptively learned Graph regularization (FNMFG) in which the graph
   is jointly learned with simultaneous performing the matrix
   factorization. An efficient iterative method with guaranteed convergence
   and relative low complexity is developed to optimize the FNMFG
   objective. Experiments compare FNMFG method with state-of-the-art
   algorithms and demonstrate its improved performance.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the matrix factorization models, concept factorization (CF)
   achieved promising performance in learning data representation in both
   original feature space and reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
   Based on the consensuses that 1) learning performance of models can be
   enhanced by exploiting the geometrical structure of data and 2) jointly
   performing structured graph learning and clustering can avoid the
   suboptimal solutions caused by the two-stage strategy in graph-based
   learning, we developed a new CF model with self-expression. Our model
   has a combined coefficient matrix which is able to learn more
   efficiently. In other words, we propose a CF-based joint structured
   graph learning and clustering model (JSGCF). A new efficient iterative
   method is developed to optimize the JSGCF objective function.
   Experimental results on representative data sets demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our new JSGCF algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The central task in graph-based unsupervised feature selection (GUFS)
   depends on two folds, one is to accurately characterize the geometrical
   structure of the original feature space with a graph and the other is to
   make the selected features well preserve such intrinsic structure.
   Currently, most of the existing GUFS methods use a two-stage strategy
   which constructs graph first and then perform feature selection on this
   fixed graph. Since the performance of feature selection severely depends
   on the quality of graph, the selection results will be unsatisfactory if
   the given graph is of low-quality. To this end, we propose a joint graph
   learning and unsupervised feature selection (JGUFS) model in which the
   graph can be adjusted to adapt the feature selection process. The JGUFS
   objective function is optimized by an efficient iterative algorithm
   whose convergence and complexity are analyzed in detail. Experimental
   results on representative benchmark data sets demonstrate the improved
   performance of JGUFS in comparison with state-of-the-art methods and
   therefore we conclude that it is promising of allowing the feature
   selection process to change the data graph.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface provides a new communication bridge between the
   human mind and devices, depending largely on the accurate classification
   and identification of non-invasive EEG signals. Recently, the deep
   learning approaches have been widely used in many fields to extract
   features and classify various types of data successfully. However, the
   deep learning approach requires massive data to train its neural
   networks, and the amount of data impacts greatly on the quality of the
   classifiers. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines deep
   learning and data augmentation for EEG classification. We applied the
   empirical mode decomposition on the EEG frames and mixed their intrinsic
   mode functions to create new artificial EEG frames, followed by
   transforming all EEG data into tensors as inputs of the neural network
   by complex Morlet wavelets. We proposed two neural
   networks-convolutional neural network and wavelet neural network-to
   train the weights and classify two classes of motor imagery signals. The
   wavelet neural network is a new type of neural network using wavelets to
   replace the convolutional layers. The experimental results show that the
   artificial EEG frames substantially improve the training of neural
   networks, and both two networks yield relatively higher classification
   accuracies compared to prevailing approaches. Meanwhile, we also
   verified the performance of our new proposed wavelet neural network
   model in the classification of steady-state visual evoked potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Tensor train decomposition is a powerful representation for high-order
   tensors, which has been successfully applied to various machine learning
   tasks in recent years. In this paper, we study a more generalized tensor
   decomposition with a ring-structured network by employing circular
   multilinear products over a sequence of lower-order core tensors. We
   refer to such tensor decomposition as tensor ring (TR) representation.
   Our goal is to introduce learning algorithms including sequential
   singular value decompositions and blockwise alternating least squares
   with adaptive tensor ranks. Experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the TR model and the learning algorithms. In
   particular, we show that the structure information and high-order
   correlations within a 2D image can be captured efficiently by employing
   an appropriate tensorization and TR decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Two examples of muli-level explanations of brain activity are provided.
   First study is aimed at extraction of information from EEG to recognize
   which brain regions are active using spectral fingerprinting. It is
   based on forward and inverse modeling of electric potentials measured by
   sensors placed on the scalp, and computing power spectra from different
   brain locations. Reliable recognition of specific brain activity using
   EEG may lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and various
   new ways of building brain-computer interfaces. In the second study,
   infant EEG data collected at our BabyLAB were used to derive
   Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), in an oddball paradigm with two types
   of deviant stimuli (easy and hard) and one standard stimuli. Tensor
   decomposition of these signals, conforming to non-negative Canonical
   Polyadic decomposition (NCPD) model and non-negative Tucker
   decomposition (NTD), is used to characterize differences in processing
   these stimuli. Multi-domain temporal, spectral, time-frequency
   representation (TFR) and spatial information features are simultaneously
   analyzed for more reliable representation of the underlying source of
   brain activity. Results show right-side asymmetry for 5-frequency (Hz)
   theta band and may be due to the dynamical process of expectancy and
   surprise, corresponding to deviant detection reflected in the mismatch
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is effective for
   epilepsy diagnosis. However, it also takes a lot of time for clinicians
   to correctly interpret the long-time recordings. Real-time
   computer-based EEG monitoring and classification systems have attracted
   recently the attention of researchers to help clinicians locate online
   possible epileptic-form EEG signals. In this paper, we first present an
   accurate and fast EEG classification algorithm that can recognize three
   types of EEG signals: normal, spike, and seizure. 16-channel bipolar EEG
   recordings of epilepsy patients are preprocessed, segmented, and
   ensemble empirical mode decomposed (EEMD) into intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs). Features are extracted and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is
   applied to train two classifiers: one is for seizure and non-seizure
   discrimination, and the other is for normal and spike discrimination. In
   order to furthermore help the clinicians, the results of LDA are
   visualized and sonified. The changes of the discriminant in the LDA on
   continuous EEG segments are backtracked to each feature, and thus to
   each EEG channel. Accordingly, contours of the changes in EEG channels
   are depicted. At the same time, sinusoidal waves in 440 or 880 Hz are
   played when EEG segments are classified into spike or seizure
   respectively. In the experiment, EEG recordings of six subjects (two
   normal and four seizure patients) are examined. The experiment result
   shows that the accuracy of the proposed epileptic EEG classification
   algorithm is relatively high. In addition, the visualization and
   sonification algorithms of epileptic-form EEG may greatly help
   clinicians localize the focus of seizure and nurses take care of seizure
   patients, immediately.}},

Abstract = {{Most current state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms use images
   captured by cameras, which operate in the visible spectral range as
   input data. Thus, image recognition systems that build on top of those
   algorithms can not provide acceptable recognition quality in poor
   lighting conditions, e.g. during nighttime. Another significant
   limitation of such systems is high demand for computational resources,
   which makes them impossible to use on low-powered embedded systems
   without GPU support. This work attempts to create an algorithm for
   pattern recognition that will consolidate data from visible and infrared
   spectral ranges and allow near real-time performance on embedded systems
   with infrared and visible sensors. First, we analyze existing methods of
   combining data from different spectral ranges for object detection task.
   Based on the analysis, an architecture of a deep convolutional neural
   network is proposed for the fusion of multi-spectral data. This
   architecture is based on the single shot multi-box detection algorithm.
   Comparison analysis of the proposed architecture with previously
   proposed solutions for the multi-spectral object detection task shows
   comparable or better detection accuracy with previous algorithms and
   significant improvement of the running time on embedded systems. This
   study was conducted in collaboration with Philips Lighting Research Lab
   and solutions based on the proposed architecture will be used in image
   recognition systems for the next generation of intelligent lighting
   systems. Thus, the main scientific outcomes of this work include an
   algorithm for multi-spectral pattern recognition based on convolutional
   neural networks, as well as a modification of detection algorithms for
   working on embedded systems.}},

Abstract = {{Digital mammography is one of the most widely used approaches for breast
   cancer diagnosis. Many researchers have demonstrated the superiority of
   machine learning methods in breast cancer diagnosis using different
   mammography databases. Since these methods often have different pros and
   cons, which may confuse doctors and researchers, an elaborate comparison
   and examination among them is urgently needed for practical breast
   cancer diagnosis. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive
   comparative study of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods that
   are promising in breast cancer diagnosis. For this purpose we analyze
   the largest mammography diagnosis database: Digital Database for
   Screening Mammography (DDSM). We considered various approaches for
   feature extraction including principal component analysis (PCA),
   nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), spatial-temporal discriminant
   analysis (STDA) and those for classification including linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA), random forests (RaF), k-nearest neighbors
   (kNN), as well as deep learning methods including convolutional neural
   networks (CNN) and stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE). This paper can
   serve as a guideline and useful clues for doctors who are going to
   select machine learning methods for their breast cancer computer-aided
   diagnosis (CAD) systems as well for researchers interested in developing
   more reliable and efficient methods for breast cancer diagnosis.}},

   Approach}},
Journal = {{COGNITIVE COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{One of the current issues in brain-computer interface (BCI) is how to
   deal with noisy electroencephalography (EEG) measurements organized as
   multidimensional datasets (tensors). On the other hand, recently,
   significant advances have been made in multidimensional signal
   completion algorithms that exploit tensor decomposition models to
   capture the intricate relationship among entries in a multidimensional
   signal. We propose to use tensor completion applied to EEG data for
   improving the classification performance in a motor imagery BCI system
   with corrupted measurements. Noisy measurements (electrode
   misconnections, subject movements, etc.) are considered as unknowns
   (missing samples) that are inferred from a tensor decomposition model
   (tensor completion). We evaluate the performance of four recently
   proposed tensor completion algorithms, CP-WOPT (Acar et al. Chemom
   Intell Lab Syst. 106:41-56, 2011), 3DPB-TC (Caiafa et al. 2013), BCPF
   (Zhao et al. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell. 37(9):1751-1763,
   2015), and HaLRT (Liu et al. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell.
   35(1):208-220, 2013), plus a simple interpolation strategy, first with
   random missing entries and then with missing samples constrained to have
   a specific structure (random missing channels), which is a more
   realistic assumption in BCI applications. We measured the ability of
   these algorithms to reconstruct the tensor from observed data. Then, we
   tested the classification accuracy of imagined movement in a BCI
   experiment with missing samples. We show that for random missing
   entries, all tensor completion algorithms can recover missing samples
   increasing the classification performance compared to a simple
   interpolation approach. For the random missing channels case, we show
   that tensor completion algorithms help to reconstruct missing channels,
   significantly improving the accuracy in the classification of motor
   imagery (MI), however, not at the same level as clean data. Summarizing,
   compared to the interpolation case, all tensor completion algorithms
   succeed to increase the classification performance by 7-9\% (LDA-SVD)
   for random missing entries and 15-8\% (LDA-SVD) for random missing
   channels. Tensor completion algorithms are useful in real BCI
   applications. The proposed strategy could allow using motor imagery BCI
   systems even when EEG data is highly affected by missing channels and/or
   samples, avoiding the need of new acquisitions in the calibration stage.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral images (HSIs), during the acquisition process, are often
   corrupted by a mixture of several types of noises, including Gaussian
   noise, impulsive noise, dead lines, stripes, and many others. These
   mixed noises not only severely degrade the visual quality of HSIs, but
   also limit the related subsequent applications. In this paper, we
   propose a novel robust principal component analysis approach for mixed
   noise removal by fully identifying the intrinsic structures of the mixed
   noise and clean HSI. Specifically, for the noise modeling, considering
   that the mixed noise consists of the dense Gaussian noise and sparse
   noise, and even the noise densities in different bands are disparate, we
   introduce a series of Gaussian-Laplace mixture distributions with the
   band-adaptive scale parameters to estimate the mixed noise. For the
   image modeling, since there exist rich correlations among the spectral
   bands and many self-similarities over the image blocks, we initialize a
   spatial-spectral low-rank characterization of the image. Furthermore, we
   impose the anisotropic spatial-spectral total variation regularization
   on the image to enhance the robustness of our approach. Then, by
   combining the expectation-maximization algorithm and the alternative
   direction method of multiplier, we develop an efficient algorithm for
   the resulting optimization problem. Extensive experimental results on
   the simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is
   superior over the existing state-of-the-art ones.}},

Abstract = {{At cocktail parties, our brains often simultaneously receive visual and
   auditory information. Although the cocktail party problem has been
   widely investigated under auditory-only settings, the effects of
   audiovisual inputs have not. This study explored the effects of
   audiovisual inputs in a simulated cocktail party. In our fMRI
   experiment, each congruent audiovisual stimulus was a synthesis of 2
   facial movie clips, each of which could be classified into 1 of 2
   emotion categories (crying and laughing). Visual-only (faces) and
   auditory-only stimuli (voices) were created by extracting the visual and
   auditory contents from the synthesized audiovisual stimuli. Subjects
   were instructed to selectively attend to 1 of the 2 objects contained in
   each stimulus and to judge its emotion category in the visual-only,
   auditory-only, and audiovisual conditions. The neural representations of
   the emotion features were assessed by calculating decoding accuracy and
   brain pattern-related reproducibility index based on the fMRI data. We
   compared the audiovisual condition with the visual-only and
   auditory-only conditions and found that audiovisual inputs enhanced the
   neural representations of emotion features of the attended objects
   instead of the unattended objects. This enhancement might partially
   explain the benefits of audiovisual inputs for the brain to solve the
   cocktail party problem.}},

   Tumor (Frantz Tumor): A Case Report}},

Abstract = {{Background: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas, first
   described by Frantz in 1959, are a very rare entity and account for
   0.13-2.7\% of all pancreatic neoplasms. They are seen predominantly in
   young women in their second and third decade of life.
   Case Report: We report a case of a 51-year-old female first diagnosed
   with a pancreatic tumor in 2010 following a computed tomography (CT)
   scan of the abdomen. The lesion was originally thought to be a
   neuroendocrine tumor subsequently treated with chemotherapy, which
   delayed the appropriate treatment. The tumor was rediagnosed as a SPN
   only after pancreatectomy was performed. Due to the fact that the
   neoplasm metastasized to the liver, the patient underwent an orthotopic
   cadaveric liver transplantation (OLTx) in 2013. During the postoperative
   period lymph node metastases were identified in the abdomen. The patient
   received surgical treatment and palliative radiotherapy. Presently no
   signs of recurrence are found either in the bed of pancreatic resection
   or in the transplanted liver. The function of the transplant organ has
   demonstrated no abnormalities over the 4-year follow-up.
   Conclusions: SPN of the pancreas is a rare disease associated with
   heterogeneous clinical course ranging from benign to metastatic.
   Choosing appropriate treatment requires individual clinical assessment
   of the disease's spread. Partial living donor liver transplantation or
   cadaveric liver transplantation might prove an effective therapeutic
   option for patients with multiple SPN metastases in the liver. It ought
   to be remembered, however, that the experience in this area is quite
   limited.}},

Abstract = {{The start of the cue is often used to initiate the feature window used
   to control motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI)
   systems. However, the time latency during an MI period varies between
   trials for each participant. Fixing the starting time point of MI
   features can lead to decreased system performance in MI-based BCI
   systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel correlation-based
   time window selection (CTWS) algorithm for MI-based BCIs. Specifically,
   the optimized reference signals for each class were selected based on
   correlation analysis and performance evaluation. Furthermore, the
   starting points of time windows for both training and testing samples
   were adjusted using correlation analysis. Finally, the feature
   extraction and classification algorithms were used to calculate the
   classification accuracy. With two datasets, the results demonstrate that
   the CTWS algorithm significantly improved the system performance when
   compared to directly using feature extraction approaches. Importantly,
   the average improvement in accuracy of the CTWS algorithm on the
   datasets of healthy participants and stroke patients was 16.72\% and
   5.24\%, respectively when compared to traditional common spatial pattern
   (CSP) algorithm. In addition, the average accuracy increased 7.36\% and
   9.29\%, respectively when the CTWS was used in conjunction with
   Sub-Alpha-Beta Log-Det Divergences (Sub-ABLD) algorithm. These findings
   suggest that the proposed CTWS algorithm holds promise as a general
   feature extraction approach for MI-based BCIs. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Objective. Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based
   brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning
   algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used
   in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately
   ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been
   developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is
   therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms
   for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature
   from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that
   have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in
   order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs,
   what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main
   results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms
   for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive
   classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep
   learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these,
   adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to
   static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can
   also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain
   unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached
   state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be
   explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage
   linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly
   useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep
   learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over
   state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a
   comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in
   EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines
   on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges
   to further advance EEG classification in BCI.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important issues for the development of a motor-imagery
   based brain-computer interface (BCI) is how to design a powerful
   classifier with strong generalization capability. Extreme learning
   machine (ELM) has recently proven to be comparable or more efficient
   than support vector machine for many pattern recognition problems. In
   this study, we propose a multi-kernel ELM (MKELM)-based method for motor
   imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. The kernel extension
   of ELM provides an elegant way to circumvent calculation of the hidden
   layer outputs and inherently encode it in a kernel matrix. We
   investigate effects of two different kernel functions (i.e., Gaussian
   kernel and polynomial kernel) on the performance of kernel ELM. The
   MKELM method is subsequently developed by integrating these two types of
   kernels with a multi-kernel learning strategy, which can effectively
   explore the supplementary information from multiple nonlinear feature
   spaces for more robust classification of EEG. An extensive experimental
   comparison with two public EEG datasets indicates that the MKELM method
   gives higher classification accuracy than those of the other competing
   algorithms. The experimental results confirm that superiority of the
   proposed MKELM-based method for accurate classification of EEG
   associated with motor imagery in BCI applications. Our method also
   provides a promising and generalized solution to investigate the complex
   and nonlinear information for various applications in the fields of
   expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose a novel semi-automatic approach to design biomarkers for
   capturing pharmacodynamic effects induced by pharmacological agents on
   the spectral power of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. We apply
   this methodology to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of
   methylphenidate (MPH) and atomoxetine (ATX) on attention
   deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), using rodent models. We inject
   the two agents into the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of
   ADHD, the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), and the Wistar rat (WIS), and record
   their EEG patterns. To assess individual EEG patterns quantitatively, we
   use an integrated methodological approach, which consists of calculating
   the mean, slope and intercept parameters of temporal records of EEG
   spectral power using a smoothing filter, outlier truncation, and linear
   regression. We apply Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) to identify
   dominant discriminants to be heuristically consolidated into several new
   composite biomarkers. Results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
   t-test show benefits in pharmacodynamic parameters, especially the slope
   parameter. Composite biomarker evaluation confirms their validity for
   genetic model stratification and the effects of the pharmacological
   agents used. The methodology proposed is of generic use as an approach
   to investigating thoroughly the dynamics of the EEG spectral power.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We analyze the dynamics of rodent EEG amplitude in an
   experiment accompanied by video recordings. Brain activity of animals is
   commonly acquired together with a video of behavior, but recordings are
   rarely combined in analysis. The data acquired is most commonly analyzed
   separately. To our knowledge, no study has used behavior to improve the
   analysis of EEG waveforms, specifically for artifact removal - other
   than through manual editing.
   Comparison with existing method(s): We explore two approaches: a
   traditional approach that relies on data preprocessing and artifact
   rejection by an expert; and an alternative approach that combines
   analysis of EEG with behavior extracted from video recordings.
   New method: We use the level of activity extracted from the behavioral
   video as a measure of confidence in the acquired EEG waveform, and as a
   weighting factor in averaging and statistical comparisons.
   Results: We find in analysis of the EEG that the two approaches lead to
   similar conclusions, but the analysis leveraging behavioral data
   achieves this while avoiding many subjective choices often required for
   artifact rejection and data preprocessing.
   Conclusions: The methods we describe allow for the inclusion of all
   recorded data in the analysis, thereby making statistical tests more
   friendly to interpretation, and making the data processing transparent
   and reproducible. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

Abstract = {{Estimating mental workload from brain signals such as
   Electroencephalography (EEG) has proven very promising in multiple
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications, e.g., to design games or
   educational applications with adaptive difficulty, or to assess how
   cognitively difficult to use an interface can be. However, current
   EEG-based workload estimation may not be robust enough for some
   practical applications. Indeed, the currently obtained workload
   classification accuracies are relatively low, making the resulting
   estimations not fully trustable. This paper thus studies promising
   modern machine learning algorithms, including Riemannian geometry-based
   methods and Deep Learning, to estimate workload from EEG signals. We
   study them with both user-specific and user-independent calibration, to
   go towards calibration-free systems. Our results suggested that a
   shallow Convolutional Neural Network obtained the best performance in
   both conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the used data
   sets. This suggests that Deep Learning can bring new possibilities in
   HCI.}},

Abstract = {{Noise Removal in medical images is a requisite preprocessing step for
   medical image analysis. In this paper, we present three deep learning
   architectures: Convolutional Auto-encoders, U-Net and a Double U-Net
   architecture utilizing convolution layers for medical Image De-noising.
   We use PSNR(Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) and SSIM(Structural Similarity
   Index Metric) to compare the results of the networks. In our
   experiments, the variant of the U-Net architecture implemented performed
   better than the two architectures in terms of its SSIM.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we introduce a matrix product operator, also called
   tensor train matrix, representation of discrete-time multilinear state
   space models and develop a corresponding system identification method.
   Using matrix product operators allows us to store the exponential number
   of model coefficients with a linear storage complexity. The derived
   system identification algorithm estimates the matrix product operator of
   the multilinear state space model directly from the measured data. This
   results in lower computational complexity compared to traditional
   nonlinear optimization methods. The effectiveness of our proposed model
   and method is demonstrated by a numerical experiment, where the
   identification of a degree-16 multilinear state space system in MATLAB
   on a standard desktop computer takes about 8 minutes with a relative
   validation error of 0.003\%. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{Large scale multidimensional data are often available as multiway arrays
   or higher-order tensors which can be approximately represented in
   distributed forms via low-rank tensor decompositions and tensor
   networks. Our particular emphasis is on elucidating that, by virtue of
   the underlying low-rank approximations, tensor networks have the ability
   to reduce the dimensionality and alleviate the curse of dimensionality
   in a number of applied areas, especially in large scale optimization
   problems and deep learning. We briefly review and provide tensor links
   between low-rank tensor network decompositions and deep neural networks.
   We elucidating, through graphical illustrations, that low-rank tensor
   approximations and sophisticated contractions of core tensors, tensor
   networks have the ability to perform distributed computations on
   otherwise prohibitively large volume of data/parameters. Our focus is on
   the Hierarchical Tucker, tensor train (TT) decompositions and MERA
   tensor networks in specific applications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method for common and individual feature analysis from
   exceedingly large-scale data is proposed, in order to ensure the
   tractability of both the computation and storage and thus mitigate the
   curse of dimensionality, a major bottleneck in modern data science. This
   is achieved by making use of the inherent redundancy in so-called
   multi-block data structures, which represent multiple observations of
   the same phenomenon taken at different times, angles or recording
   conditions. Upon providing an intrinsic link between the properties of
   the outer vector product and extracted features in tensor decompositions
   (TDs), the proposed common and individual information extraction from
   multi-block data is performed through constraints which impose physical
   meaning on otherwise unconstrained factorisation approaches. This is
   shown to dramatically reduce the dimensionality of search spaces in
   subsequent classification procedures and to yield greatly enhanced
   accuracy. Simulations on a multi-class classification task of
   large-scale extraction of individual features from a collection of
   partially related real-world images demonstrate the advantages of the
   ``blessing of dimensionality{''} associated with TDs.}},

Abstract = {{With advantages of high concealment, non-stealing, and liveness
   detection, electroencephalography (EEG) identification has a broad
   application prospect in the fields with high confidentiality and
   security requirements. At present, EEG identification usually requires
   external stimuli or particular tasks imposed on participators, such as
   identification based on movement imagination (MI) and event-related
   potential (ERP), which restricts its promotion in real life. To overcome
   the limitation, we assume a task-related EEG can be divided into a
   background EEG (BEEG) containing one's unique intrinsic features and a
   residue EEG (REEG) composed of task-evoked EEG and random noise.
   Furthermore, we suppose only a few features can reveal one's identity.
   Therefore, BEEG represents a low-rank characteristic, suitable for
   personal identification. In this paper, we proposed a fast LRMD-based
   EEG identification algorithm with maximum correntropy criterion (MCC)
   and rational quadratic kernel, which can efficiently extract BEEG out
   and deliver a high accuracy classification. Extensive experiments
   conducted on three public EEG datasets and a self-collected multi-task
   EEG dataset all achieve outstanding performance under the low rank of
   BEEG data matrix and various time length scales of short-time Fourier
   Transform (STFT), which means that our approach does not depend on the
   task type. Besides, the experimental results provide a reference for the
   time length of an appropriate EEG signal sample.}},

Abstract = {{Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been attracting a great interest
   in recent years. The common spatial patterns (CSP) technique is a
   well-established approach to the spatial filtering of the
   electroencephalogram (EEG) data in BCI applications. Even though CSP was
   originally proposed from a heuristic viewpoint, it can be also built on
   very strong foundations using information theory. This paper reviews the
   relationship between CSP and several information-theoretic approaches,
   including the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Beta divergence and the
   Alpha-Beta log-det (AB-LD)divergence. We also revise other approaches
   based on the idea of selecting those features that are maximally
   informative about the class labels. The performance of all the methods
   will be also compared via experiments.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy,
   associated with poor outcome and few therapeutic options. Despite
   increasing attention, the knowledge about the clinical course and
   treatment of these tumors is limited.
   OBJECTIVES Survival rates in ACC are still low and the percentage of
   relapse is high. Thus, it is crucial to identify the prognostic factors
   of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). PATIENTS
   AND METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of 66 patients diagnosed
   with ACC between 2002 and 2015.
   RESULTS The median OS was 43.5 months, 78.19 months for stage I + II,
   22.95 months for stage III, and 19.54 months for stage IV ACC. Older
   age, stage IV ACC, margin status R2, and no mitotane treatment were
   associated with poor OS. Low Ki67 and mitotic indices were related to
   improved OS in a univariate analysis. The median RFS was 101.1 months.
   Disease recurrence after potentially curative surgery was reported in 1
   patient (25\%) with stage I, 12 patients (46\%) with stage II, and 9
   patients (45\%) with stage III ACC. Male sex and no mitotane treatment
   were associated with a reduced RFS in a multivariate analysis and higher
   Ki67 and mitotic indices in the univariate analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS Ki67 and mitotic indices should be considered as prognostic
   factors when planning the adjuvant treatment of ACC. Mitotane treatment
   may be independently associated with better outcomes regardless of the
   tumor stage.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasms (ANEN) are mostly
   indolent tumours treated effectively with simple appendectomy. However,
   controversy exists regarding the necessity of oncologic right
   hemicolectomy (RH) in patients with histologic features suggestive of
   more aggressive disease. We assess the effects of current guidelines in
   selecting the surgical strategy (appendectomy or RH) for the management
   of ANEN. Methods/Aims: This is a retrospective review of all ANEN cases
   treated over a 14-year period at 3 referral centres and their management
   according to consensus guidelines of the European and the North American
   Neuroendocrine Tumor Societies (ENETS and NANETS, respectively). The
   operation performed, the tumour stage and grade, the extent of residual
   disease, and the follow-up outcomes were evaluated. Results: Of 14,850
   patients who had appendectomies, 215 (1.45\%) had histologically
   confirmed ANEN. Four patients had synchronous non-ANEN malignancies. One
   hundred and ninety-three patients had index appendectomy. Seventeen
   patients (7.9\%) had lymph node metastases within the mesoappendix.
   Forty-nine patients underwent RH after appendectomy. The percentages of
   30-day morbidity and mortality after RH were 2 and 0\%, respectively.
   Twelve patients (24.5\%) receiving completion RH were found to have
   lymph node metastases. Two patients had liver metastases, both of them
   synchronous. The median follow-up was 38.5 months (range 1-143). No
   patient developed disease recurrence. Five- and 10-year overall survival
   for all patients with ANEN as the only malignancy was both 99.05\%.
   Conclusions: The current guidelines appear effective in identifying ANEN
   patients at risk of harbouring nodal disease, but they question the
   oncological relevance of ANEN lymph node metastases. RH might present an
   over-treatment for a number of patients with ANEN. (c) 2017 S. Karger

Abstract = {{It has long been known that patients with depression exhibit abnormal
   brain functional connectivity patterns, that are often studied from a
   graph-theoretic perspective. However, while certain simpler graph
   features have been examined, little has been done in the direction of
   advanced feature learning methodologies such as network embeddings. Our
   work aims to extend the understanding of importance of graph-based
   features for medical applications by evaluating the recently proposed
   anonymous walk embeddings (AWE) in difficult depression classification
   problems. For two challenging datasets, we obtain performance gains and
   investigate the learned vector representations. Our results indicate
   that using AWE-based features is a promising new direction for medical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has increasingly come to
   dominate brain mapping research, as it provides a dynamic view of brain
   matter. Feature selection or extraction methods play an important role
   in the successful application of machine learning techniques to
   classifying fMRI data by appropriately reducing the dimensionality of
   the data. While whole-brain fMRI data contains large numbers of voxels,
   the curse of dimensionality problem may limit the feature
   selection/extraction and classification performance of traditional
   methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a tensor
   neural network (TensorNet) to extract the essential and discriminative
   features from the whole-brain fMRI data. The tensor train model was
   employed to construct a simple and shallow neural network and compress a
   large number of network weight parameters. The proposed framework can
   avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, and allow us to extract
   effective patterns from the whole-brain fMRI data. Furthermore, it
   reveals a new perspective for analyzing complex fMRI data with a large
   numbers of voxels, through compressing the number of parameters in a
   neural network. Experimental results confirmed that our proposed
   classification framework based on TensorNet outperforms traditional
   methods based on an SVM classifier for multi-class fMRI data.}},

   Nonnegative Matrix Factorization}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{58096-58105}},
Abstract = {{Nonsmooth nonnegative matrix factorization (nsNMF) is capable of
   producing more localized, less overlapped feature representations than
   other variants of NMF while keeping satisfactory fit to data. However,
   nsNMF as well as other existing NMF methods are incompetent to learn
   hierarchical features of complex data due to its shallow structure. To
   fill this gap, we propose a deep nsNMF method coined by the fact that it
   possesses a deeper architecture compared with standard nsNMF. The deep
   nsNMF not only gives part-based features due to the nonnegativity
   constraints but also creates higher level, more abstract features by
   combing lower level ones. The in-depth description of how deep
   architecture can help to efficiently discover abstract features in
   dnsNMF is presented, suggesting that the proposed model inherits the
   major advantages from both deep learning and NMF. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate the standout performance of the proposed method in
   clustering analysis.}},

Abstract = {{EEG-based hyper-scanning refers to two or more subjects engaged in a
   task together or performing the same action together while
   neurophysiological signals are simultaneously recorded from them. This
   is one of the manners for investigating between-subject neural
   activities involved in social interactions. Emotion perception plays an
   important role in human social interactions. Interaction and emotional
   state influence each other. In this study, we aim to investigate how
   between-subject interaction modulates emotion perception based on event
   related potentials (ERPs), connectivity analysis and classification
   analysis. We found that there are distinct differences appearing between
   paired subjects who performed the task together, which are early ERP
   components (N250 and N400), late ERP components (P1500 and N1500), and
   the greater amplitude in N250 for the seconding responding subject
   compared to the first one. In the exploration of connectivity using
   phase locking value (PLV), we found that there are significant
   differences among different frequency bands for each subject under
   positive and negative stimuli and the significant difference of
   hyper-connectivity existed in the gamma frequency band between positive
   and negative stimulus trials. In the classification analysis, we
   compared the hyper-features for two individual subjects separately, the
   performance was improved when hyper-features of the PLV was employed
   compared to the features of power spectrum density.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the neural dynamical network to compute a best
   rank-one approximation of a real valued tensor. We implement the neural
   network model by the ordinary differential equations (ODE), which is a
   class of continuous-time recurrent neural network. Several new
   properties of solutions for the neural network are established. We prove
   that the locally asymptotic stability of solutions for ODE by
   constructive an appropriate Lyapunov function under mild conditions.
   Furthermore, we also discuss how to use the proposed neural networks for
   solving the tensor eigenvalue problem including the tensor H-eigenvalue
   problem, the tensor Z-eigenvalue problem, and the generalized eigenvalue
   problem with symmetric-definite tensor pairs. Finally, we generalize the
   proposed neural networks to the computation of the restricted singular
   values and the associated restricted singular vectors of real-valued
   tensors. We illustrate and validate theoretical results via numerical
   simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the background noise estimation technique of the
   tensor product expansion with absolute error (TPE-AE) to estimate
   multiple sources. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal produced by the
   saccadic eye movement is adopted to analyze relationship between a brain
   function and a human activity. The electrooculogram (EOG) generated by
   eye movements yields significant problems for the EEG analysis. The
   denoising of EOG artifacts is important task to perform an accurate
   analysis. In this paper, the two types of TPE-AE are proposed to
   estimates EOG and other components in EEG during eye movement. One
   technique estimates two outer products using median filter based TPE-AE.
   The another technique uses a reference signal to separate the two
   sources. We show that the proposed method is effective to estimate and
   separate two sources in EEG.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{313-320}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Tensor diagonalization means transforming a given tensor to an exactly
   or nearly diagonal form through multiplying the tensor by non-orthogonal
   invertible matrices along selected dimensions of the tensor. It has a
   link to an approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) of a set of matrices.
   In this paper, we derive (1) a new algorithm for a symmetric AJD, which
   is called two-sided symmetric diagonalization of an order-three tensor,
   (2) a similar algorithm for a non-symmetric AJD, also called a two-sided
   diagonalization of an order-three tensor, and (3) an algorithm for
   three-sided diagonalization of order-three or order-four tensors. The
   latter two algorithms may serve for canonical polyadic (CP) tensor
   decomposition, and in certain scenarios they can outperform traditional
   CP decomposition methods. Finally, we propose (4) similar algorithms for
   tensor block diagonalization, which is related to tensor block-term
   decomposition. The proposed algorithm can either outperform the existing
   block-term decomposition algorithms, or produce good initial points for
   their application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor
   behavior. The MI-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide
   communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI-based
   BCI mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate
   electroencephalogram signals. Proper training can help naive subjects
   learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, training
   subjects typically involve abstract motor tasks and are time-consuming.
   Methods: to improve the performance of naive subjects during motor
   imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects
   to modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures
   of the left or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the
   motor imagery task. Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25
   years, and mean 23.6 +/- 1.16) participated in this study. The task was
   to imagine writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could
   imagine hand movements corresponding to the sequence of writing strokes
   in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective
   and familiar action formost Chinese people, to provide them with a
   specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain
   activity. Results: results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded
   significantly better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p
   < 0.001). Questionnaire replies indicated that most subjects thought
   that the new paradigm was easier. Conclusion: the proposed new motor
   imagery paradigm could guide subjects to help them modulate brain
   activity effectively. Results showed that there were significant
   improvements using new paradigm, both in classification accuracy and
   usability.}},

Title = {{A New Generation of Brain-Computer Interfaces Driven by Discovery of
   Latent EEG-fMRI Linkages Using Tensor Decomposition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a setup permitting the control of
   external devices by decoding brain activity. Electroencephalography
   (EEG) has been extensively used for decoding brain activity since it is
   non-invasive, cheap, portable, and has high temporal resolution to allow
   real-time operation. Due to its poor spatial specificity, BCIs based on
   EEG can require extensive training and multiple trials to decode brain
   activity (consequently slowing down the operation of the BCI). On the
   other hand, BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   are more accurate owing to its superior spatial resolution and
   sensitivity to underlying neuronal processes which are functionally
   localized. However, due to its relatively low temporal resolution, high
   cost, and lack of portability, fMRI is unlikely to be used for routine
   BCI. We propose a new approach for transferring the capabilities of fMRI
   to EEG, which includes simultaneous EEG/fMRI sessions for finding a
   mapping from EEG to fMRI, followed by a BCI run from only EEG data, but
   driven by fMRI-like features obtained from the mapping identified
   previously. Our novel data-driven method is likely to discover latent
   linkages between electrical and hemodynamic signatures of neural
   activity hitherto unexplored using model-driven methods, and is likely
   to serve as a template for a novel multi-modal strategy wherein
   cross-modal EEG-fMRI interactions are exploited for the operation of a
   unimodal EEG system, leading to a new generation of EEG-based BCIs.}},

Title = {{An improved P300 pattern in BCI to catch user's attention}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can help patients who have
   lost control over most muscles but are still conscious and able to
   communicate or interact with the environment. One of the most popular
   types of BCI is the P300-based BCI. With this BCI, users are asked to
   count the number of appearances of target stimuli in an experiment. To
   date, the majority of visual P300-based BCI systems developed have used
   the same character or picture as the target for every stimulus
   presentation, which can bore users. Consequently, users attention may
   decrease or be negatively affected by adjacent stimuli. Approach. In
   this study, a new stimulus is presented to increase user concentration.
   Honeycomb-shaped figures with 1-3 red dots were used as stimuli. The
   number and the positions of the red dots in the honeycomb-shaped figure
   were randomly changed during BCI control. The user was asked to count
   the number of the dots presented in each flash instead of the number of
   times they flashed. To assess the performance of this new stimulus,
   another honeycomb-shaped stimulus, without red dots, was used as a
   control condition. Main results. The results showed that the
   honeycomb-shaped stimuli with red dots obtained significantly higher
   classification accuracies and information transfer rates (p < 0.05)
   compared to the honeycomb-shaped stimulus without red dots.
   Significance. The results indicate that this proposed method can be a
   promising approach to improve the performance of the BCI system and can
   be an efficient method in daily application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical method is proposed for canonical polyadic
   (CP) decomposition of small size tensors. The focus is primarily on
   decomposition of tensors that correspond to small matrix
   multiplications. Here, rank of the tensors is equal to the smallest
   number of scalar multiplications that are necessary to accomplish the
   matrix multiplication. The proposed method is based on a constrained
   Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Numerical results indicate the rank
   and border ranks of tensors that correspond to multiplication of
   matrices of the size 2 x 3 and 3 x 2, 3 x 3 and 3 x 2, 3 x 3 and 3 x 3,
   and 3 x 4 and 4 x 3. The ranks are 11, 15, 23 and 29, respectively. In
   particular, a novel algorithm for computing product of matrices of the
   sizes 3 x 4 and 4 x 3 using 29 multiplications is presented. (C) 2016

Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{120-125}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are rare neoplasms that
   originate from neuroendocrine cells and are characterized by the
   potential of hormonal activity. Approximately 70\% of these tumours are
   located in the gastrointestinal system (GI), followed by the bronchi,
   endocrine glands-like C cells of the thyroid (medullary carcinoma), the
   parasympathetic and sympathetic system (paragangliomas,
   pheochromocytoma) and other very rare locations. The prevalence of
   cerebral metastases in neuroendocrine tumours is estimated by various
   authors to be approximately 1.5-5\%. When the primary tumour is located
   in the pancreas, it is associated with a risk of cerebral metastases
   lower than 2\%.
   Case Report: We describe a patient with a disseminated pancreatic NEN
   that presented with an isolated lesion in the brain. We gathered the
   important data via medical history,, observation, analysis of medical
   records, imaging and others diagnostic tests. Despite the fairly rare
   prevalence of cerebral metastases in NENs, a neurological work-up should
   be performed. This should include neuroimaging of the brain, preferably
   with MR, together with the somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), in
   each clinically suspicious case.
   A histopathological examination of the CNS tumour can confirm a
   dedifferentiation of NEN in the direction of a neuroendocrine carcinoma
   (NEC - neuroednocrine carcinoma) with a poor prognosis.
   Conclusions: Cerebral metastases are diagnosed in 1.5-5\% of patients
   with a neuroendocrine neoplasm. In each case suggestive of a
   dissemination into the central nervous system, MRI of the brain should
   be performed.}},

Title = {{Optimization of Alpha-Beta Log-Det Divergences and their Application in
   the Spatial Filtering of Two Class Motor Imagery Movements}},
Journal = {{ENTROPY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences for positive definite matrices are
   flexible divergences that are parameterized by two real constants and
   are able to specialize several relevant classical cases like the squared
   Riemannian metric, the Steins loss, the S-divergence, etc. A novel
   classification criterion based on these divergences is optimized to
   address the problem of classification of the motor imagery movements.
   This research paper is divided into three main sections in order to
   address the above mentioned problem: (1) Firstly, it is proven that a
   suitable scaling of the class conditional covariance matrices can be
   used to link the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) solution with a predefined
   number of spatial filters for each class and its representation as a
   divergence optimization problem by making their different filter
   selection policies compatible; (2) A closed form formula for the
   gradient of the Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences is derived that allows to
   perform optimization as well as easily use it in many practical
   applications; (3) Finally, in similarity with the work of Samek et al.
   2014, which proposed the robust spatial filtering of the motor imagery
   movements based on the beta-divergence, the optimization of the
   Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences is applied to this problem. The resulting
   subspace algorithm provides a unified framework for testing the
   performance and robustness of the several divergences in different
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Model selection in tensor decomposition is important for real
   applications if the rank of the original data tensor is unknown and the
   observed tensor is noisy. In the Tucker model, the minimum description
   length (MDL) or Bayesian information criteria have been applied to
   tensors via matrix unfolding, but these methods are sensitive to noise
   when the tensors have a multilinear low rank structure given by the
   Tucker model. In this study, we propose new methods for improving the
   MDL so it is more robust to noise. The proposed methods are justified
   theoretically by analyzing the ``multilinear low-rank structure{''} of
   tensors. Extensive experiments including numerical simulations and a
   real application to image denoising are provided to illustrate the
   advantages of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{L1-regularized multiway canonical correlation analysis (L1-MCCA) has
   been introduced to reference signal optimization in steady-state visual
   evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The
   effectiveness of L1-regularization on significant trial selection highly
   depends on the regularization parameter setting, which can be typically
   determined by cross-validation (CV). However, CV will substantially
   reduce the practicability of BCI system due to additional data
   requirement for the parameter validation and relatively high
   computational cost. To solve the problem, this study proposes a Bayesian
   version of L1-MCCA (called SBMCCA) by exploiting sparse Bayesian
   learning. The SBMCCA method avoids CV and can efficiently estimate the
   model parameters under the Bayesian evidence framework. Experimental
   results show that the SBMCCA method achieved comparable recognition
   accuracy but much higher computational efficiency in contrast to the
   L1-MCCA method.}},

Abstract = {{Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), also known as PARAFAC, is a
   representation of a given tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors.
   Traditional method for accomplishing CPD is the alternating least
   squares (ALS) algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement with very
   low computational complexity per iteration. A disadvantage is that in
   difficult scenarios, where factor matrices in the decomposition contain
   nearly collinear columns, the number of iterations needed to achieve
   convergence might be very large. In this paper, we propose a
   modification of the algorithm which has similar complexity per iteration
   as ALS, but in difficult scenarios it needs a significantly lower number
   of iterations.}},

   blind sources separation, blind identification, clustering, and analysis

   symmetric tensors, and its symmetric tensor decomposition. By imposing
   unit-length constraints on components, we resort the optimisation
   problem to the constrained eigenvalue decomposition in which
   eigenvectors are represented in form of rank-1 matrices. To this end, we
   develop an augmented Lagrangian algorithm with simple update rules. The
   proposed algorithm has been compared with the Trust-Region solver over
   manifold, and achieved higher success rates. The algorithm is also
   validated for blind identification, and achieves more stable results
   than the ALSCAF algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the revised Polish guidelines regarding the
   management of patients suffering from neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of
   the small intestine and appendix. The small intestine, especially the
   ileum, is the most common location for these neoplasms. Most are well
   differentiated and slow growing. Their symptoms may be atypical, which
   can result in delayed or accidental diagnosis. Appendicitis is usually
   the first manifestation of NEN in this location. Typical symptoms of
   carcinoid syndrome occur in approximately 20-30\% of patients suffering
   from small intestinal NENs with distant metastases. The main cause of
   death in patients with carcinoid syndrome is carcinoid heart disease.
   The most useful laboratory test is the determination of chromogranin A,
   while concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is helpful in the
   diagnostics of carcinoid syndrome. For visualisation, ultrasound,
   computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy, video
   capsule endoscopy, double-balloon enteroscopy, and somatostatin receptor
   scintigraphy may be used. A detailed histological report is crucial for
   the proper diagnostics and therapy of NENs of the small intestine and
   appendix. The treatment of choice is surgical management, either radical
   or palliative. The pharmacological treatment of the hormonally active
   and non-active small intestinal NENs as well as NENs of the appendix is
   based on long-acting somatostatin analogues. In patients with
   generalised NENs of the small intestine in progress during the SSA
   treatment, with good expression of somatostatin receptors, the
   first-line treatment should be radioisotope therapy, while targeted
   therapies, such as everolimus, should be considered afterwards. When the
   above therapies are exhausted, in certain cases chemotherapy may be
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is an increasing number of adrenal being tumours
   discovered incidentally during imaging examinations performed for many
   different indications. Radiological findings suggesting adrenal
   pathology may be caused by true adrenal tumours or by other
   retroperitoneal masses. Generally, the larger the tumour, the higher the
   possibility of adrenal cancer.
   Material and methods: Analysis of our data - 139 operations performed
   over 11 years (2004-2014) in patients with tumours in the adrenal area
   larger than 5 cm.
   Results: The most common finding was adrenal cancer (25.2\%), benign
   adenoma (24.5\%), pheochromocytoma (12.9\%), and metastatic cancer
   (10.1\%). In total, there were 19 various histopathological diagnoses in
   this group.
   Conclusion: Although adrenal cancer is the most likely diagnosis in
   large adrenal tumours, a broad spectrum of various adrenal and
   retroperitoneal tumours with size more than 5 cm can be found in such
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG) is always used to diagnosis the patients
   consciousness clinically because it is safe and easy to be record from
   patients. The aim of this paper is to analysis the relations between
   each channel in order to find out the brain network of brain death and
   coma patients particularity. In this paper, we use 10 adult patients'
   EEG data to calculate the partial directed coherence (PDC) and build the
   average brain network for the two groups' data after t-test based on the
   PDC results. Results showed that, these two clinical data are at most
   difference in the network parameters of degree, centrality and cluster
   coefficient as the threshold of PDC is set of 0.3. The time-varying
   connectivity could lead to better understanding of non-symmetric
   relations between different EEG channels and application in prediction
   of patients in brain death or coma state.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing noise in a video sequence is of vital important in many
   real-world applications. One popular method is block matching
   collaborative filtering. However, the main drawback of this method is
   that noise standard deviation for the whole video sequence is known in
   advance. In this paper, we present a tensor based denoising framework
   that considers 3D patches instead of 2D patches. By collecting the
   similar 3D patches non-locally, we employ the low-rank tensor
   decomposition for collaborative filtering. Since we specify the
   non-informative prior over the noise precision parameter, the noise
   variance can be inferred automatically from observed video data.
   Therefore, our method is more practical, which does not require knowing
   the noise variance. The experimental on video denoising demonstrates the
   effectiveness of our proposed method.}},

   (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN), results of new randomised clinical

   This article presents the general recommendations for the management of
   NENs, developed by experts during the 3rd Round Table Conference -
   Diagnosis and therapy of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine
   neoplasms: Polish recommendations in view of current European
   recommendations, which took place in December 2016 in Zelechow near
   Warsaw. Based on the extensive experience of the centres dealing with
   this type of neoplasms we believe that we have developed the optimal
   management system, for these patients which applies the most recent
   achievements and can be implemented effectively in Poland.
   These management guidelines have been arranged in the following order:
   gastric and duodenal NENs (including gastrinoma); pancreatic NENs; NENs
   of the small intestine and appendix, and colorectal NENs.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents updated diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for
   the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNEN), proposed by
   the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours. The guidelines contain new
   data received in the years 2013-2016, which confirm previous
   recommendations, and have led to modification of previous guidelines or
   have resulted in the formulation of new guidelines. Biochemical and
   imaging (anatomical and functional) tests are of great importance in
   diagnostics, as well as histopathological diagnosis to determine the
   management of PNEN patients, but they must be confirmed by an
   immunohistochemical examination. PNEN therapy requires collaboration
   among members of a multidisciplinary of specialists experienced in the
   management of these neoplasms. Surgery is the basic form of treatment in
   many cases. Further therapy requires a multidirectional procedure;
   therefore, the rules of biotherapy, peptide receptor radionuclide
   therapy, molecular targeted therapy, and chemotherapy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Denoising, noise or interferences are removed from recorded signal to
   enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is a crucial and ubiquitous
   step in the procedure of signal processing, especially for
   neurophysiological signal. This step facilitates following processing,
   such as feature extraction, classification, and data analyses.
   Conventional methods are based on the principle of separating noise
   components from the recorded signal and removing them, but these methods
   do not remove noise completely. In particular, conventional methods
   seems powerless to eliminate irregular and occasional noise bursts,
   which are caused by transient electrode contacting problem, head
   movements, or unpredictable factors. In this paper, we tackled the
   problem of noise removal from a new perspective, which is opposite to
   the conventional methods. Data portions that are contaminated by noise
   are entirely removed and then restored according to their relationships
   with the remaining signal. The rationale of this procedure is to purify
   the signal through addition rather than deduction that is normally
   executed in conventional methods. The results of both synthetic data and
   real EEG demonstrated that our idea is feasible and provides a new
   promising manner for noise removal.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological signals are often organized in the form of multiple
   dimensions (e.g., channel, time, task, and 3-D voxel), so it is better
   to preserve original organization structure when processing. Unlike
   vector-based methods that destroy data structure, canonical polyadic
   decomposition (CPD) aims to process physiological signals in the form of
   multiway array, which considers relationships between dimensions and
   preserves structure information contained by the physiological signal.
   Nowadays, CPD is utilized as an unsupervised method for feature
   extraction in a classification problem. After that, a classifier, such
   as support vector machine, is required to classify those features. In
   this manner, classification task is achieved in two isolated steps. We
   proposed supervised CPD by directly incorporating auxiliary label
   information during decomposition, by which a classification task can be
   achieved without an extra step of classifier training. The proposed
   method merges the decomposition and classifier learning together, so it
   reduces procedure of classification task compared with that of
   respective decomposition and classification. In order to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method, three different kinds of signals,
   synthetic signal, EEG signal, and MEG signal, were used. The results
   based on evaluations of synthetic and real signals demonstrated that the
   proposed method is effective and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with estimation of structured signals such as damped
   sinusoids, exponentials, polynomials, and their products from single
   channel data. It is shown that building tensors from this kind of data
   results in tensors with hidden block structure which can be recovered
   through the tensor diagonalization. The tensor diagonalization means
   multiplying tensors by several matrices along its modes so that the
   outcome is approximately diagonal or block-diagonal of 3-rd order
   tensors. The proposed method can be applied to estimation of parameters
   of multiple damped sinusoids, and their products with polynomial.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroendocrine neoplasms/tumours (NENs/NETs) of the large intestine are
   detected increasingly often, especially rectal tumours, which is
   probably associated with the widespread use of screening colonoscopy.
   There is a growing body of evidence supporting the thesis that the NENs
   of the rectum and the NENs of the colon are two different diseases.
   Rectal NENs are usually small lesions, of low to moderate histological
   malignancy, associated with good prognosis, and most may be treated
   endoscopically. NENs of the colon, however, are often aggressive, poorly
   differentiated, associated with a poor or uncertain prognosis, and
   require surgical treatment. The management guidelines regarding these
   groups of patients are constantly changing. On the basis of the recent
   literature data and conclusions reached by the working meeting of the
   Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours (December 2016), this study
   completes and updates the data and management guidelines regarding
   colorectal NENs published in Endokrynologia Polska 2013; 64: 358-368.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of multidimensional arrays, usually called tensors, often
   becomes difficult in cases when the tensor rank (a minimum number of
   rank-one components) exceeds all the tensor dimensions. Traditional
   methods of canonical polyadic decomposition of such tensors, namely the
   alternating least squares, can be used, but a presence of a large number
   of false local minima can make the problem hard. Usually, multiple
   random initializations are advised in such cases, but the question is
   how many such random initializations are sufficient to get a good chance
   of finding the right solution. It appears that the number of the
   initializations can be very large. We propose a novel approach to the
   problem. The given tensor is augmented by some unknown parameters to the
   shape that admits ordinary tensor diagonalization, i.e., transforming
   the augmented tensor into an exact or nearly diagonal form through
   multiplying the tensor by non-orthogonal invertible matrices. Three
   possible constraints are proposed to make the optimization problem well
   defined. The method can be modified for an under-determined block-term
   decomposition.}},
