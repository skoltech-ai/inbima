Abstract = {{Optimal rank selection is an important issue in tensor decomposition
   problems, especially for Tensor Train (TT) and Tensor Ring (TR) (also
   known as Tensor Chain) decompositions. In this paper, a new rank
   selection method for TR decomposition has been proposed for
   automatically finding near-optimal TR ranks, which result in a lower
   storage cost, especially for tensors with inexact TT or TR structures.
   In many of the existing approaches, TR ranks are determined in advance
   or by using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD). There are
   also other approaches for selecting TR ranks adaptively. In our
   approach, the TR ranks are not determined in advance, but are increased
   gradually in each iteration until the model achieves a desired
   approximation accuracy. For this purpose, in each iteration, the
   sensitivity of the approximation error to each of the core tensors is
   measured and the core tensors with the highest sensitivity measures are
   selected and their sizes are increased. Simulation results confirmed
   that the proposed approach reduces the storage cost considerably and
   allows us to find optimal model in TR format, while preserving the
   desired accuracy of the approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Big data analysis has become a crucial part of new emerging technologies
   such as the internet of things, cyber-physical analysis, deep learning,
   anomaly detection, etc. Among many other techniques, dimensionality
   reduction plays a key role in such analyses and facilitates feature
   selection and feature extraction. Randomized algorithms are efficient
   tools for handling big data tensors. They accelerate decomposing
   large-scale data tensors by reducing the computational complexity of
   deterministic algorithms and the communication among different levels of
   memory hierarchy, which is the main bottleneck in modern computing
   environments and architectures. In this article, we review recent
   advances in randomization for computation of Tucker decomposition and
   Higher Order SVD (HOSVD). We discuss random projection and sampling
   approaches, single-pass and multi-pass randomized algorithms and how to
   utilize them in the computation of the Tucker decomposition and the
   HOSVD. Simulations on synthetic and real datasets are provided to
   compare the performance of some of best and most promising algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Decompositions of tensors into factor matrices, which interact through a
   core tensor, have found numerous applications in signal processing and
   machine learning. A more general tensor model that represents data as an
   ordered network of subtensors of order-2 or order-3 has, so far, not
   been widely considered in these fields, although this so-called tensor
   network (TN) decomposition has been long studied in quantum physics and
   scientific computing. In this article, we present novel algorithms and
   applications of TN decompositions, with a particular focus on the tensor
   train (TT) decomposition and its variants. The novel algorithms
   developed for the TT decomposition update, in an alternating way, one or
   several core tensors at each iteration and exhibit enhanced mathematical
   tractability and scalability for large-scale data tensors. For rigor,
   the cases of the given ranks, given approximation error, and the given
   error bound are all considered. The proposed algorithms provide
   well-balanced TT-decompositions and are tested in the classic paradigms
   of blind source separation from a single mixture, denoising, and feature
   extraction, achieving superior performance over the widely used
   truncated algorithms for TT decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{A novel algorithm to solve the quadratic programming (QP) problem over
   ellipsoids is proposed. This is achieved by splitting the QP problem
   into two optimisation sub-problems, (1) quadratic programming over a
   sphere and (2) orthogonal projection. Next, an augmented-Lagrangian
   algorithm is developed for this multiple constraint optimisation.
   Benefitting from the fact that the QP over a single sphere can be solved
   in a closed form by solving a secular equation, we derive a tighter
   bound of the minimiser of the secular equation. We also propose to
   generate a new positive semidefinite matrix with a low condition number
   from the matrices in the quadratic constraint, which is shown to improve
   convergence of the proposed augmented-Lagrangian algorithm. Finally,
   applications of the quadratically constrained QP to bounded linear
   regression and tensor decomposition paradigms are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is a convenient and intuitive
   tool for tensor factorization; however, for higher order tensors, it
   often exhibits high computational cost and permutation of tensor
   entries, and these undesirable effects grow exponentially with the
   tensor order. Prior compression of tensor in-hand can reduce the
   computational cost of CPD, but this is only applicable when the rank R
   of the decomposition does not exceed the tensor dimensions. To resolve
   these issues, we present a novel method for CPD of higher order tensors,
   which rests upon a simple tensor network of representative
   interconnected core tensors of orders not higher than 3. For rigor, we
   develop an exact conversion scheme from the core tensors to the factor
   matrices in CPD and an iterative algorithm of low complexity to estimate
   these factor matrices for the inexact case. Comprehensive simulations
   over a variety of scenarios support the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Face Representations via Tensorfaces of Various Complexities}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Neurons selective for faces exist in humans and monkeys. However,
   characteristics of face cell receptive fields are poorly understood. In
   this theoretical study, we explore the effects of complexity, defined as
   algorithmic information (Kolmogorov complexity) and logical depth, on
   possible ways that face cells may be organized. We use tensor
   decompositions to decompose faces into a set of components, called
   tensorfaces, and their associated weights, which can be interpreted as
   model face cells and their firing rates. These tensorfaces form a
   high-dimensional representation space in which each tensorface forms an
   axis of the space. A distinctive feature of the decomposition algorithm
   is the ability to specify tensorface complexity. We found that
   low-complexity tensorfaces have blob-like appearances crudely
   approximating faces, while high-complexity tensorfaces appear clearly
   face-like. Low-complexity tensorfaces require a larger population to
   reach a criterion face reconstruction error than medium- or
   high-complexity tensorfaces, and thus are inefficient by that criterion.
   Low-complexity tensorfaces, however, generalize better when representing
   statistically novel faces, which are faces falling beyond the
   distribution of face description parameters found in the tensorface
   training set. The degree to which face representations are parts based
   or global forms a continuum as a function of tensorface complexity, with
   low and medium tensorfaces being more parts based. Given the
   computational load imposed in creating high-complexity face cells (in

Abstract = {{Weighted canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition appears in a wide
   range of applications. A typical situation where the weighted
   decomposition is needed is when some tensor elements are unknown, and
   the task is to fill in the missing elements under the assumption that
   the tensor admits a low-rank model. The traditional methods for
   large-scale decomposition tasks are based on alternating least-squares
   methods or gradient methods. Second-order methods might have
   significantly better convergence, but so far they were used only on
   small tensors. The proposed Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt method enables to
   do second-order-based iterations even in large-scale decomposition
   problems, with or without weights. We show in simulations that the
   proposed technique can outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms
   in some scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is an important task in
   many applications. Many times, the true tensor rank is not known, or
   noise is present, and in such situations, different existing CP
   decomposition algorithms provide very different results. In this letter,
   we introduce a notion of sensitivity of CP decomposition and suggest to
   use it as a side criterion (besides the fitting error) to evaluate
   different CP decomposition results. Next, we propose a novel variant of
   a Krylov-Levenberg-Marquardt CP decomposition algorithm which may serve
   for CP decomposition with a constraint on the sensitivity. In
   simulations, we decompose order-4 tensors that come from convolutional
   neural networks. We show that it is useful to combine the CP
   decomposition algorithms with an error-preserving correction.}},

Abstract = {{In CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition, degeneracy often occurs in
   some difficult scenarios, especially, when the rank exceeds the tensor
   dimension, or when the loading components are highly collinear in
   several or all modes, or when CPD does not have an optimal solution. In
   such cases, norms of some rank-1 tensors become significantly large and
   cancel each other. This makes algorithms getting stuck in local minima
   while running a huge number of iterations does not improve the
   decomposition. In this paper, we propose an error preservation
   correction method to deal with such problem. Our aim is to seek an
   alternative tensor, which preserves the approximation error, but norms
   of rank-1 tensor components of the new tensor are minimized. Alternating
   and all-at-once correction algorithms have been developed for the
   problem. In addition, we propose a novel CPD with a bound constraint on
   the norm of the rank-one tensors. The method can be useful for
   decomposing tensors that cannot be performed by traditional algorithms.
   Finally, we demonstrate an application of the proposed method in image
   denoising and decomposition of the weight tensors in convolutional
   neural networks.}},

   the multilinear state space model directly from the measured data. This
   results in lower computational complexity compared to traditional
   nonlinear optimization methods. The effectiveness of our proposed model
   and method is demonstrated by a numerical experiment, where the

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Tensor diagonalization means transforming a given tensor to an exactly
   or nearly diagonal form through multiplying the tensor by non-orthogonal
   invertible matrices along selected dimensions of the tensor. It has a
   link to an approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) of a set of matrices.
   In this paper, we derive (1) a new algorithm for a symmetric AJD, which
   is called two-sided symmetric diagonalization of an order-three tensor,
   (2) a similar algorithm for a non-symmetric AJD, also called a two-sided
   diagonalization of an order-three tensor, and (3) an algorithm for
   three-sided diagonalization of order-three or order-four tensors. The
   latter two algorithms may serve for canonical polyadic (CP) tensor
   decomposition, and in certain scenarios they can outperform traditional
   CP decomposition methods. Finally, we propose (4) similar algorithms for
   tensor block diagonalization, which is related to tensor block-term
   decomposition. The proposed algorithm can either outperform the existing
   block-term decomposition algorithms, or produce good initial points for
   their application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical method is proposed for canonical polyadic
   (CP) decomposition of small size tensors. The focus is primarily on
   decomposition of tensors that correspond to small matrix
   multiplications. Here, rank of the tensors is equal to the smallest
   number of scalar multiplications that are necessary to accomplish the
   matrix multiplication. The proposed method is based on a constrained
   Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Numerical results indicate the rank
   and border ranks of tensors that correspond to multiplication of
   matrices of the size 2 x 3 and 3 x 2, 3 x 3 and 3 x 2, 3 x 3 and 3 x 3,
   and 3 x 4 and 4 x 3. The ranks are 11, 15, 23 and 29, respectively. In
   particular, a novel algorithm for computing product of matrices of the

Abstract = {{Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), also known as PARAFAC, is a
   representation of a given tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors.
   Traditional method for accomplishing CPD is the alternating least
   squares (ALS) algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement with very
   low computational complexity per iteration. A disadvantage is that in
   difficult scenarios, where factor matrices in the decomposition contain
   nearly collinear columns, the number of iterations needed to achieve
   convergence might be very large. In this paper, we propose a
   modification of the algorithm which has similar complexity per iteration
   as ALS, but in difficult scenarios it needs a significantly lower number
   of iterations.}},

   blind sources separation, blind identification, clustering, and analysis

   problem to the constrained eigenvalue decomposition in which
   eigenvectors are represented in form of rank-1 matrices. To this end, we
   develop an augmented Lagrangian algorithm with simple update rules. The
   proposed algorithm has been compared with the Trust-Region solver over

   validated for blind identification, and achieves more stable results

Abstract = {{Analysis of multidimensional arrays, usually called tensors, often
   becomes difficult in cases when the tensor rank (a minimum number of
   rank-one components) exceeds all the tensor dimensions. Traditional
   methods of canonical polyadic decomposition of such tensors, namely the
   alternating least squares, can be used, but a presence of a large number
   of false local minima can make the problem hard. Usually, multiple
   random initializations are advised in such cases, but the question is
   how many such random initializations are sufficient to get a good chance
   of finding the right solution. It appears that the number of the
   initializations can be very large. We propose a novel approach to the
   problem. The given tensor is augmented by some unknown parameters to the
   shape that admits ordinary tensor diagonalization, i.e., transforming
   the augmented tensor into an exact or nearly diagonal form through
   multiplying the tensor by non-orthogonal invertible matrices. Three
   possible constraints are proposed to make the optimization problem well
   defined. The method can be modified for an under-determined block-term
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), also known as parallel factor
   analysis, is a representation of a given tensor as a sum of rank-one
   components. Traditional method for accomplishing CPD is the alternating
   least squares (ALS) algorithm. Convergence of ALS is known to be slow,
   especially when some factor matrices of the tensor contain nearly
   collinear columns. We propose a novel variant of this technique, in
   which the factor matrices are partitioned into blocks, and each
   iteration jointly updates blocks of different factor matrices. Each
   partial optimization is quadratic and can be done in closed form. The
   algorithm alternates between different random partitionings of the
   matrices. As a result, a faster convergence is achieved. Another
   improvement can be obtained when the method is combined with the
   enhanced line search of Rajih et al. Complexity per iteration is between
   those of the ALS and the Levenberg-Marquardt (damped Gauss-Newton)
   method. It is important, however, that the idea of alternating quadratic
   optimization with partitioned factor matrices is general and can be
   applied to other variants of the tensor decomposition problems, e.g.,
   when non-Gaussian additive noise is considered.}},

Abstract = {{Modern applications in engineering and data science are increasingly
   based on multidimensional data of exceedingly high volume, variety, and
   structural richness. However, standard machine learning algorithms
   typically scale exponentially with data volume and complexity of
   cross-modal couplings - the so called curse of dimensionality which is
   prohibitive to the analysis of large-scale, multi-modal and
   multi-relational datasets. Given that such data are often efficiently
   represented as multiway arrays or tensors, it is therefore timely and
   valuable for the multidisciplinary machine learning and data analytic
   communities to review low-rank tensor decompositions and tensor networks
   as emerging tools for dimensionality reduction and large scale
   optimization problems. Our particular emphasis is on elucidating that,
   by virtue of the underlying low-rank approximations, tensor networks
   have the ability to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in a number of
   applied areas. In Part 1 of this monograph we provide innovative
   solutions to low-rank tensor network decompositions and easy to
   interpret graphical representations of the mathematical operations on
   tensor networks. Such a conceptual insight allows for seamless migration
   of ideas from the flat-view matrices to tensor network operations and
   vice versa, and provides a platform for further developments, practical
   applications, and non-Euclidean extensions. It also permits the
   introduction of various tensor network operations without an explicit
   notion of mathematical expressions, which may be beneficial for many
   research communities that do not directly rely on multilinear algebra.
   Our focus is on the Tucker and tensor train (TT) decompositions and
   their extensions, and on demonstrating the ability of tensor networks to
   provide linearly or even super-linearly (e.g., logarithmically) scalable
   solutions, as illustrated in detail in Part 2 of this monograph.}},

Abstract = {{Part 2 of this monograph builds on the introduction to tensor networks
   and their operations presented in Part 1. It focuses on tensor network
   models for super-compressed higher-order representation of
   data/parameters and related cost functions, while providing an outline
   of their applications in machine learning and data analytics.
   A particular emphasis is on the tensor train (TT) and Hierarchical
   Tucker (HT) decompositions, and their physically meaningful
   interpretations which reflect the scalability of the tensor network
   approach. Through a graphical approach, we also elucidate how, by virtue
   of the underlying low-rank tensor approximations and sophisticated
   contractions of core tensors, tensor networks have the ability to
   perform distributed computations on otherwise prohibitively large
   volumes of data/parameters, thereby alleviating or even eliminating the
   curse of dimensionality.
   The usefulness of this concept is illustrated over a number of applied
   areas, including generalized regression and classification (support
   tensor machines, canonical correlation analysis, higher order partial
   least squares), generalized eigenvalue decomposition, Riemannian
   optimization, and in the optimization of deep neural networks.
   Part 1 and Part 2 of this work can be used either as stand-alone
   separate texts, or indeed as a conjoint comprehensive review of the
   exciting field of low-rank tensor networks and tensor decompositions.}},

Abstract = {{Tensor train (TT) is one of the modern tensor decomposition models for
   low-rank approximation of high-order tensors. For nonnegative multiway
   array data analysis, we propose a nonnegative TT (NTT) decomposition
   algorithm for the NTT model and a hybrid model called the NTT-Tucker
   model. By employing the hierarchical alternating least squares approach,
   each fiber vector of core tensors is optimized efficiently at each
   iteration. We compared the performances of the proposed method with a
   standard nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) algorithm by using
   benchmark data sets including event-related potential data and facial
   image data in multi-domain feature extraction and clustering tasks. It
   is illustrated that the proposed algorithm extracts physically
   meaningful features with relatively low storage and computational costs
   compared to the standard NTD model.}},

Abstract = {{CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) approximates multiway data by sum of rank-1
   tensors. Unlike matrix decomposition, the procedure which estimates the
   best rank-R tensor approximation through R sequential best rank-1
   approximations does not work for tensors, because the deflation does not
   always reduce the tensor rank. In this paper, we propose a novel
   deflation method for the problem. When one factor matrix of a rank-R CP
   decomposition is of full column rank, the decomposition can be performed
   through (R - 1) rank-1 reductions. At each deflation stage, the residue
   tensor is constrained to have a reduced multilinear rank. For
   decomposition of order-3 tensors of size R x R x R and rank-R,
   estimation of one rank-1 tensor has a computational cost of O(R-3) per
   iteration which is lower than the cost O(R-4) of the ALS algorithm for
   the overall CP decomposition. The method can be extended to tracking one
   or a few rank-one tensors of slow changes, or inspect variations of
   common patterns in individual datasets.}},

   nearest-neighbor graph-based constraints that are obtained from the
   knowledge on class labels of training samples. The constraints are
   usually incorporated to NMF algorithms by l(2)-weighted penalty terms
   that involve formulating a large-size weighting matrix. Using the Newton
   method for updating the latent factors, the optimization problems in NMF
   become large-scale. However, the computational problem can be
   considerably alleviated if the modified Spectral Projected Gradient
   (SPG) that belongs to a class of quasi-Newton methods is used. The
   simulation results presented for the selected classification problems
   demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures is a popular
   solution to inverse problems encountered in audio or biomedical
   applications where the number of sources exceeds the number of sensors.
   There are two non-equivalent tasks: to identify the mixing matrix and to
   separate the original sources. In this paper, we focus on the latter
   task by proposing a novel beamformer that minimizes the theoretical mean
   square error distance between the separated and original signals. The
   beamformer has two stages: one for the estimation of signals and one for
   their refinement. Within the former stage, the signals are assumed to be
   random and locally stationary, while the latter stage is based on a
   semi-deterministic model. The experiments prove superior performance of
   the proposed method compared to conventional MMSE beamforming.}},

Abstract = {{CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) has found numerous applications in wide variety
   of areas such as in chemometrics, telecommunication, data mining,
   neuroscience, separated representations. For an order-N tensor, most CP
   algorithms can be computationally demanding due to computation of
   gradients which are related to products between tensor unfoldings and
   Khatri-Rao products of all factor matrices except one. These products
   have the largest workload in most CP algorithms. In this paper, we
   propose a fast method to deal with this issue. The method also reduces
   the extra memory requirements of CP algorithms. As a result, we can
   accelerate the standard alternating CP algorithms 20-30 times for
   order-5 and order-6 tensors, and even higher ratios can be obtained for
   higher order tensors (e.g., N >= 10). The proposed method is more
   efficient than the state-of-the-art ALS algorithm which operates two
   modes at a time (ALSo2) in the Eigenvector PLS toolbox, especially for
   tensors with order N >= 5 and high rank.}},

Abstract = {{In general, algorithms for order-3 CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), also coined
   canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), are easy to implement and can be
   extended to higher order CPD. Unfortunately, the algorithms become
   computationally demanding, and they are often not applicable to higher
   order and relatively large scale tensors. In this paper, by exploiting
   the uniqueness of CPD and the relation of a tensor in Kruskal form and
   its unfolded tensor, we propose a fast approach to deal with this
   problem. Instead of directly factorizing the high order data tensor, the
   method decomposes an unfolded tensor with lower order, e.g., order-3
   tensor. On the basis of the order-3 estimated tensor, a structured
   Kruskal tensor, of the same dimension as the data tensor, is then
   generated, and decomposed to find the final solution using fast
   algorithms for the structured CPD. In addition, strategies to unfold
   tensors are suggested and practically verified in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizations of precoding matrices in precode-and-forward (PF) MIMO
   relaying are nonconvex programs in precoding matrix variables. The
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, which relaxes the concerned
   nonconvex quadratic constraints by (convex) semi-definite ones, can
   locate the optimal solutions, provided that the numbers of relaying
   antennas and users are very small. The computational complexity of the
   SDR grows explosively even with a very moderate increase in the numbers
   of relaying antennas and/or users, making the existing semidefinite
   programming (SDP) solvers incapable. In this paper, much more efficient
   problem formulations of precoding matrix design that exploit the
   spectral matrix optimization are developed. Such formulations have a low
   dimensionality and are computationally-tractable nonconvex matrix
   programs. Furthermore, by exploiting their partial convex structures in
   the d.c. (difference of two convex functions) framework, new effective
   iterative solutions are obtained. Extensive simulation results are
   presented to support the computational advantage of the proposed
   approach and show that the proposed approach can effectively handle all
   three considered optimization problems of precoding matrices in MIMO PF
   relaying, while the SDR approach either is computationally impractical
   or fails.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the variance of
   unbiased estimates of factor matrices in Canonical Polyadic (CP) or
   CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decompositions of a tensor from noisy
   observations, (i.e., the tensor plus a random Gaussian i.i.d. tensor). A
   novel expression is derived for a bound on the mean square angular error
   of factors along a selected dimension of a tensor of an arbitrary
   dimension. The expression needs less operations for computing the bound,
   O(NR6), than the best existing state-of-the art algorithm, O((NR6)-R-3)
   operations, where and are the tensor order and the tensor rank.
   Insightful expressions are derived for tensors of rank 1 and rank 2 of
   arbitrary dimension and for tensors of arbitrary dimension and rank,
   where two factor matrices have orthogonal columns.
   The results can be used as a gauge of performance of different
   approximate CP decomposition algorithms, prediction of their accuracy,
   and for checking stability of a given decomposition of a tensor
   (condition whether the CRLB is finite or not). A novel expression is
   derived for a Hessian matrix needed in popular damped Gauss-Newton
   method for solving the CP decomposition of tensors with missing
   elements. Beside computing the CRLB for these tensors the expression may
   serve for design of damped Gauss-Newton algorithm for the decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{The damped Gauss-Newton (dGN) algorithm for CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
   decomposition can handle the challenges of collinearity of factors and
   different magnitudes of factors; nevertheless, for factorization of an
   order-N tensor of size I-1 x ... x I-N with rank R, the algorithm is
   computationally demanding due to construction of a large approximate
   Hessian of size (RT x RT) and its inversion where T = Sigma(n) I-n. In
   this paper, we propose a fast implementation of the dGN algorithm which
   is based on novel expressions of the inverse approximate Hessian in
   block form. The new implementation has lower computational complexity,
   besides computation of the gradient (this part is common to both
   methods), requiring the inversion of a matrix of size N R-2 x N R-2,
   which is much smaller than the whole approximate Hessian, if T >> N R.
   In addition, the implementation has lower memory requirements, because
   neither the Hessian nor its inverse never needs to be stored in its
   entirety. A variant of the algorithm working with complex-valued data is
   proposed as well. Complexity and performance of the proposed algorithm
   is compared with those of dGN and ALS with line search on examples of
   difficult benchmark tensors.}},

Abstract = {{Several variants of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) have been
   proposed for supervised classification of various objects. Graph
   regularized NMF (GNMF) incorporates the information on the data
   geometric structure to the training process, which considerably improves
   the classification results. However, the multiplicative algorithms used
   for updating the underlying factors may result in a slow convergence of
   the training process. To tackle this problem, we propose to use the
   Spectral Projected Gradient (SPG) method that is based on quasi-Newton
   methods. The results are presented for image classification problems.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the design of optimal transmit beamforming vectors for
   cognitive radio multicast transmission can be formulated as indefinite
   quadratic optimization programs. Given the challenges of such nonconvex
   problems, the conventional approach in literature is to recast them as
   convex semidefinite programs (SDPs) together with rank-one constraints.
   Then, these nonconvex and discontinuous constraints are dropped allowing
   for the realization of a pool of relaxed candidate solutions, from which
   various randomization techniques are utilized with the hope to recover
   the optimal solutions. However, it has been shown that such approach
   fails to deliver satisfactory outcomes in many practical settings,
   wherein the determined solutions are found to be unacceptably far from
   the actual optimality. On the contrary, we in this contribution tackle
   the aforementioned optimal beamforming problems differently by
   representing them as SDPs with additional reverse convex (but
   continuous) constraints. Non-smooth optimization algorithms are then
   proposed to locate the optimal solutions of such design problems in an
   efficient manner. Our thorough numerical examples verify that the
   proposed algorithms offer almost global optimality whilst requiring
   relatively low computational load.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative least squares (ALS) algorithm is considered as a
   ``work-horse{''} algorithm for general tensor factorizations. A common
   form of this algorithm for nonnegative tensor factorizations (NTF) is
   always combined with a nonlinear projection (rectifier) to enforce
   nonnegative entries during the estimation. Such simple modification
   often provides acceptable results for general data. However, this does
   not establish an appropriate ALS algorithm for NTF. This kind of ALS
   algorithm often converges slowly, or cannot converge to the desired
   solution, especially for collinear data. To this end, in this paper, we
   reinvestigate the nonnegative quadratic programming, propose a recursive
   method for solving this problem. Then, we formulate a novel ALS
   algorithm for NTF. The validity and high performance of the proposed
   algorithm has been confirmed for difficult benchmarks, and also in an
   application of object classification, and analysis of EEG signals.}},

   ongoing EEG was first produced, and then a fourth-order tensor including
   the spectrograms of multiple channels of multiple participants was
   decomposed via nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) into four factors,
   including temporal, spectral and spatial components, and multi-domain
   features of all participants. We found one extracted temporal component
   by NTF significantly (p < 0.01) correlated with the temporal course of a
   long-term music feature, `fluctuation centroid'; moreover, the power of
   posterior alpha activity was found to be associated with this temporal
   component. Hence, it looks promising to apply the proposed method for
   analyzing other ongoing EEG elicited by other natural stimuli.}},

   childrenand 21 children with reading disability. We first rejected data
   of one subject in each group and produced 441 sub-datasets including 40

   through nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) from event-related
   potentials, and used the leave-one-out paradigm for classification.
   Averaged accuracies over 441 sub-datasets were 77.98\% (linear
   discriminate analysis), 73.55\% (support vector machine), and 76.97\%
   (adaptive boosting). In summary, assuming K observations with known
   labels, for the new observation without the group information, the
   feature of the new observation can be extracted through performing NTD
   to extract features from data of all observations (K+1). Since the group
   information of the first K observations is known, their features can
   train the classifier, and then, the trained classifier recognizes new
   features to determine the group information of new observation.}},

   The difficulty of this problem consists in low signal-to-noise ratio,

   suppressed using a recently proposed underdetermined blind source

   remove unwanted components of EEG to increase the classification

Abstract = {{Classification methods have been widely applied in most brain computer
   interfaces (BCIs) that control devices for better quality of life. Most
   existing classification methods for P300-based BCIs extract features
   based on temporal structure related to P300 components of event-related
   potentials (ERPs). Some others exploit the spatial distribution of ERPs
   optimally selected by recursive channel elimination. However, none of
   them employed multilinear structures which exploit hidden features in
   P300-based BCI data. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction
   method based on tensor decomposition for ERP-based BCIs. The method
   seeks an optimal feature subspace simultaneously spanned by temporal and
   spatial bases, and additional bases which indicate a variant of ERPs
   obtained by different degrees of polynomial fittings. The proposed
   method has been evaluated by both the BCI competition III data set II
   and the affective face driven paradigm data set, and achieved 92\% and
   95\% classification accuracies respectively, which were better than
   those of most existing P300-based BCI algorithms.}},

   can obtain the optimal beamforming, it introduces a large number of

   this paper, we recast the MIMO relay beamforming problem as an
   optimization problem of spectral functions. As compared to previous SDR
   methods, our formulation significantly reduces the number of auxiliary
   variables while the optimal solutions are still achieved by an efficient

   our proposed method offers a lower computational time as compared to the

Abstract = {{Total relay transmit power minimization in Amplify-forward (AF) MIMO
   relay beamforming is naturally formulated as an indefinite quadratic
   (nonconvex) program and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique can
   be used to locate their optimal solutions. Indeed, SDR often gives
   rank-one optimal solution within a low number of relaying antennas and
   communicating users. However, as the antennas number increases, the
   computational complexity of SDR grows up explosively that requires a
   huge amount of additional variables. In this paper, a more efficient
   problem formulation is introduced, which needs a much reduced number of
   auxiliary variables but the optimal solutions are still achieved
   iteratively. Furthermore, it works as well as for max-min relay power
   optimization, for which SDR seems to be powerless for solution.
   Simulation shows the viability of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of high dimensional data in modern applications, such as
   neuroscience, text mining, spectral analysis, chemometrices naturally
   requires tensor decomposition methods. The Tucker decompositions allow
   us to extract hidden factors (component matrices) with different
   dimension in each mode, and investigate interactions among various
   modalities. The alternating least squares (ALS) algorithms have been
   confirmed effective and efficient in most of tensor decompositions,
   especially Tucker with orthogonality constraints. However, for
   nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD), standard ALS algorithms suffer
   from unstable convergence properties, demand high computational cost for
   large scale problems due to matrix inverse, and often return suboptimal
   solutions. Moreover they are quite sensitive with respect to noise, and
   can be relatively slow in the special case when data are nearly
   collinear. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for nonnegative
   Tucker decomposition based on constrained minimization of a set of local
   cost functions and hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS). The
   developed NTD-HALS algorithm sequentially updates components, hence
   avoids matrix inverse, and is suitable for large-scale problems. The
   proposed algorithm is also regularized with additional constraint terms
   such as sparseness, orthogonality, smoothness, and especially
   discriminant. Extensive experiments confirm the validity and higher
   performance of the developed algorithm in comparison with other existing
   algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is a tensor (multiway array)
   factorization method which allows to find hidden factors (component
   matrices) from a multidimensional data. Most of the existing algorithms
   for the PARAFAC, especially the alternating least squares (ALS)
   algorithm need to compute Khatri-Rao products of tall factors and
   multiplication of large matrices, and due to this require high
   computational cost and large memory and are not suitable for very
   large-scale-problems. Hence, PARAFAC for large-scale data tensors is
   still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach
   based on a modified ALS algorithm which computes Hadamard products,
   instead Khatri-Rao products, and employs relatively small matrices. The
   new algorithms are able to process extremely large-scale tensors with
   billions of entries. Extensive experiments confirm the validity and high

Abstract = {{The multiplicative algorithms are well-known for nonnegative matrix and
   tensor factorizations. The ALS algorithm for canonical decomposition
   (CP) has been proved as a ``work-horse{''} algorithm for general
   multiway data. Unfortunately, for CP with nonnegativity constraints,
   this algorithm with a rectifier (projection) may not converge to the
   desired solution without additional regularization parameters in matrix
   inverses. The hierarchical ALS algorithm improves the performance of the
   ALS algorithm, outperforms the multiplicative algorithm. However, NTF
   algorithms can face problem with collinear or bias data. In this paper,
   we propose a novel algorithm which overwhelmingly outperforms all the
   multiplicative, and (H) ALS algorithms. By solving the nonnegative
   quadratic programming problems, a general algorithm of the HALS has been
   derived and experimentally confirmed its validity and high performance
   for normal and difficult benchmarks, and for real-world EEG dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Alternating optimization algorithms for canonical polyadic decomposition
   (with/without nonnegative constraints) often accompany update rules with
   low computational cost, but could face problems of swamps, bottlenecks,
   and slow convergence. All-at-once algorithms can deal with such
   problems, but always demand significant temporary extra-storage, and
   high computational cost. In this paper, we propose an all-at-once
   algorithm with low complexity for sparse and nonnegative tensor
   factorization based on the damped Gauss-Newton iteration. Especially,
   for low-rank approximations, the proposed algorithm avoids building up
   Hessians and gradients, reduces the computational cost dramatically.
   Moreover, we proposed selection strategies for regularization
   parameters. The proposed algorithm has been verified to overwhelmingly
   outperform ``state-of-the-art{''} NTF algorithms for difficult
   benchmarks, and for real-world application such as clustering of the ORL

Abstract = {{INDSCAL is a special case of the CANDECOMP-PARAFAC (CP) decomposition of
   three or more-way tensors, where two factor matrices are equal. This
   paper provides a stability analysis of INDSCAL that is done by deriving
   the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on variance of an unbiased estimate of
   the tensor parameters from its noisy observation (the tensor plus an
   i.i.d. Gaussian random tensor). The existence of the bound reveals
   necessary conditions for the essential uniqueness of the INDSCAL
   decomposition. This is compared with previous results on CP. Next,
   analytical expressions for the inverse of the Hessian matrix, which is
   needed to compute the CRLB, are used in a damped Gaussian
   (Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm, which gives a novel method for INDSCAL

Abstract = {{Beamforming problems in amlify-forward (AF) wireless relay network can
   be formulated as nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic
   programming (QCQP) problems which is very difficult to solve directly.
   Generally, by transforming a QCQP problem into a semi-definite program
   (SDP) and by relaxing rank-one constraints, the problem can be tackled
   essentially. If resulting matrices found after solving SDP problems are
   of rank-one then the task can be terminated. However, in some scenarios
   such as minimizing individual power constraints on relays, most of the
   rank-one dropped SDP solutions have rank higher than one. In this case,
   a nonsmooth reverse convex optimization technique is employed to solve
   the problem iteratively then rank-one solutions can be optimized
   numerically.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with a multiuser communication network, which is
   assisted by multiple relays. It has been observed through our previous
   related works that the conventional simultaneous beamforming at parallel
   amply-and-forward (AF) relays is not quite effective and often
   infeasible to target practically desirable
   signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at the destinations. To
   overcome this shortage, we propose the time-division for multiple-user
   transmission to the relays so the later can perform beamforming on
   signals received from the individuals and then parallelly forward its
   combinations at once to the destinations. The optimal beamforming
   problem is a non-convex quadratically constrained optimization, which is
   globally solved by our tailored algorithm of nonsmooth optimization. Its
   found global optimal solutions are shown very effective and over-perform
   other possible multi-user relay beamformings.}},

Abstract = {{Nonnegative Matrix 1 Tensor factorization (NMF INTF) have been used in
   the study of EEG, and the fit (explained variation) is often used to
   evaluate the performance of a nonnegative decomposition algorithm.
   However, this parameter only reveals the information derived from the
   mathematical model and just exhibits the reliability of the algorithms,
   and the property of EEG can not be reflected. If fits of two algorithms
   are identical, it is necessary to examine whether the desired components
   extracted by them are identical too. In order to verify this doubt, we
   performed NMF and NTF on the same dataset of an auditory event-related
   potentials (ERPs), and found that the identical fits of NMF and NTF
   under the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithms corresponded
   to different desired ERPs extracted by NMF and NTF, moreover, NTF
   contributed the ERP with much better timing and spectral properties.
   Such analysis implies that to combine the fit and property of the
   desired ERP component together helps evaluate the performance of NMF and
   NTF algorithms in the study of ERPs.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares the row-wise unfolding nonnegative tensor
   factorization (NTF) and the standard nonnegative matrix factorization
   (NMF) in extracting time-frequency represented event-related
   potentials-mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a from EEG under the
   two-dimensional decomposition. The criterion to judge performance of NMF
   and NTF is based on psychology knowledge of MMN and P3a. MMN is elicited
   by an oddball paradigm and may be proportionally modulated by the
   attention. So, participants are usually instructed to ignore the
   stimuli. However the deviant stimulus inevitably attracts some attention
   of the participant towards the stimuli. Thus, P3a often follows MMN. As
   a result, if P3a was larger, it could mean that more attention would be
   attracted by the deviant stimulus, and then MMN could be enlarged. The
   MMN and P3a extracted by the row-wise unfolding NIT revealed this
   coupling feature. However, through the standard NW. or the raw data,
   such characteristic was not evidently observed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we use features extracted by Nonnegative Tensor
   Factorization (NTF) from event-related potentials (ERPs) to discriminate
   healthy children and children with attention deficit (AD). The peak
   amplitude of an ERP has been extensively used to discriminate different
   groups of subjects for the clinical research. However, such
   discriminations sometimes fail because the peak amplitude may vary
   severely with the increased number of subjects and wider range of ages
   and it can be easily affected by many factors. This study formulates a
   framework, using NTF to extract features of the evoked brain activities
   from time-frequency represented ERPs. Through using the estimated
   features of a negative ERP-mismatch negativity, the correct rate on the
   recognition between health children and children with AD approaches to
   about 76\%. However, the peak amplitude did not discriminate them.
   Hence, it is promising to apply NTF for diagnosing clinical children
   instead of measuring the peak amplitude.}},

Abstract = {{The amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming problems are naturally

   The typical methods for solving such optimization problems are to
   transform them into convex semi-definite programs (SDPs) with additional
   rank-one (nonconvex and discontinuous) constraints. The rank-one
   constraints are then dropped to obtain solvable SDP relaxed problems and
   randomization techniques are employed for seeking the feasible solutions
   to the original nonconvex optimization problems. In many conventional
   scenarios, the results from solving the rank-one relaxed SDP problems
   are enough to conclude the solutions since no rank-higher-than-one SDP
   resulting matrix can be observed. Through our simulations, we found that
   there are also many scenarios that the SDP solvers give high-rank
   solutions. Hence, in this paper the rank-one constraints are
   equivalently expressed as reverse convex constraints and are
   incorporated into the optimization problems. Then, we propose an
   efficient iterative algorithm for solving the nonsmooth reverse convex
   optimization problems. Our simulations show that our proposed approach

Abstract = {{Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extensions such as
   Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) have become prominent techniques
   for blind sources separation (BSS), analysis of image databases, data
   mining and other information retrieval and clustering applications. In
   this paper we propose a family of efficient algorithms tor NMF/NTF, as
   well as sparse nonnegative coding and representation, that has many
   potential applications in computational neuroscience. multisensory
   processing, compressed sensing and multidimensional data analysis. We
   have developed a class of optimized local algorithms which ate referred
   to as Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithms. For
   these purposes. we have performed sequential constrained immunization
   oil a set of squared Euclidean distances. We then extend this approach
   to robust cost functions using the alpha and beta divergences and derive
   flexible update rules. Our algorithms are locally stable and work well
   for NMF-based blind source separation (BSS) not only for the
   over-determined case but also for all under-determined (over-complete)
   case (i.e. for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data are
   sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and generalized
   for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) Moreover, these
   algorithms can be tuned to different noise statistics by adjusting a
   single parameter. Extensive experimental results confirm the accuracy
   and computational performance of the developed algorithms, especially,
   with usage of multi-layer hierarchical NMF approach {[}3].}},

Abstract = {{Nonnegative parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) (also called nonnegative
   tensor factorization - NTF) allows to find nonnegative factors hidden
   under the raw tensor data which have many potential applications in
   neuroscience, bioinformatics, chemometrics etc {[}1], {[}2]. NTF
   algorithms can be easily established based on the unfolding tensor and
   1thatri-Rao products of factors {[}1], {[}3]. This kind of algorithms
   leads to large matrices, and requires large memory for temporal
   variables. Hence decomposition of large-scale tensor is still a
   challenging problem for NTF. To deal with this problem, a new tensor
   factorization scheme is proposed, in which the data tensor will be
   divided into a grid of multiple of small-sized subtensors, then

   least squares (HALS) based compressive sensing (CS) is effectively used
   for adaptive selection of the wavelet coefficients and nonlinearly
   thresholding the transform coefficients. In this modality the source
   compression rate is influenced by the proximity to the region of
   interest (RoI), which often includes significant diagnostic information.
   Also, the channel coding scalability is affected by both the proximity
   to the RoI and the channel characteristics. The results are later

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a family of new algorithms for non-negative
   matrix/tensor factorization (NMF/NTF) and sparse nonnegative coding and
   representation that has many potential applications in computational
   neuroscicnce, multisensory, multidimensional data analysis and text
   mining. We have developed a class of local algorithms which are
   extensions of Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithms
   proposed by us in {[}1]. For these purposes, we have performed
   simultaneous constrained minimization of a get of robust cost functions
   called alpha and beta divergences. Our algorithms are locally stable and
   work well for the NMF blind source separation (BSS) not only for the
   over-determined case but also for an under-determined (over-complete)
   case (i.e., for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data
   are sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and
   generalized for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF).
   Moreover, new algorithms can be potentially accommodated to different
   noise statistics by just adjusting a single parameter. Extensive
   experimental results confirm the validity and high performance of the
   developed algorithms, especially, with usage of the multi-layer
   hierarchical approach {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{A modulating retroreflector (MRR) is used for a free-space optics (FSO)
   implementation of the MIL-STD- 1553 protocol. A multiple quantum well
   (MQW) pi-n structure is used for a single device that acts both as a
   modulator for transmitting data and as a photodiode for receiving data.
   A master node and two slave nodes with cat's eye retroreflectors were
   designed using COTS optics. Two-way communication using the 1553
   protocol is demonstrated at a separation of 3 meters, using widely
   available 980 nm pump lasers. The link was closed using only 15 mW of
   laser light. We have also demonstrated a coherent receiver to increase
   sensitivity and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to enhance the
   data rate of a bandwidth-limited MRR.}},
