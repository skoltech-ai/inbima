Abstract = {{Tensor networks are the main building blocks in various computational
   sciences, ranging from many-body theory and quantum computing to
   probability and machine learning. Here we propose a parallel algorithm
   for the contraction of tensor networks using probabilistic graphical
   models. Given a tensor network, this algorithm splits the contraction
   task almost optimally into subtasks, which can be contracted
   independently in parallel. Our approach is based on the heuristic
   solution of the mu-treewidth deletion problem in graph theory. We apply
   the resulting algorithm to the simulation of random quantum circuits and
   discuss the extensions for general tensor network contractions.
   According to our estimates, the lower bound on the simulation time of 1
   million amplitudes of a 49-qubit circuit of depth 40 on the Summit
   supercomputer is >5 seconds.}},

Title = {{Tensor-decomposition techniques for ab initio nuclear structure
   calculations: From chiral nuclear potentials to ground-state energies}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: The computational resources needed to generate the ab initio
   solution of the nuclear many-body problem for increasing mass number
   and/or accuracy necessitates innovative developments to improve upon (i)
   the storage of many-body operators and (ii) the scaling of many-body
   methods used to evaluate nuclear observables. The storing and efficient
   handling of many-body operators with high particle ranks is currently
   one of the major bottlenecks limiting the applicability range of ab
   initio studies with respect to mass number and accuracy. Recently, the
   application of tensor decomposition techniques to many-body tensors has
   proven highly beneficial to reduce the computational cost of ab initio
   calculations in quantum chemistry and solid-state physics.
   Purpose: The impact of applying state-of-the-art tensor factorization
   techniques to modern nuclear Hamiltonians derived from chiral effective
   field theory is investigated. Subsequently, the error induced by the
   tensor decomposition of the input Hamiltonian on ground-state energies
   of closed-shell nuclei calculated via second-order many-body
   perturbation theory is benchmarked.
   Methods: The first proof-of-principles application of
   tensor-decomposition techniques to the nuclear Hamiltonian is performed.
   Two different tensor formats are investigated by systematically
   benchmarking the approximation error on matrix elements stored in
   various bases of interest. The analysis is achieved while including
   normal-ordered three-nucleon interactions that are nowadays used as
   input to the most advanced ab initio calculations in medium-mass nuclei.
   With the aid of the factorized Hamiltonian, the second-order
   perturbative correction to ground-state energies is decomposed and the
   scaling properties of the underlying tensor network are discussed.
   Results: The employed tensor formats are found to lead to an efficient
   data compression of two-body matrix elements of the nuclear Hamiltonian.
   In particular, the sophisticated tensor hypercontraction scheme yields
   low tensor ranks with respect to both harmonic-oscillator and
   Hartree-Fock single-particle bases. It is found that the tensor rank
   depends on the two-body total angular momentum J for which one performs
   the decomposition, which is itself directly related to the sparsity of
   the corresponding tensor. Furthermore, including normal-ordered two-body
   contributions originating from three-body interactions does not
   compromise the efficient data compression. Ultimately, the use of
   factorized matrix elements authorizes controlled approximations of the
   exact second-order ground-state energy corrections. In particular, a
   small enough error is obtained from low-rank factorizations in He-4,
   O-16, and Ca-40.
   Conclusions: It is presently demonstrated that tensor-decomposition
   techniques can be efficiently applied to systematically approximate the
   nuclear many-body Hamiltonian in terms of lower-rank tensors. Beyond the
   input Hamiltonian, tensor-decomposition techniques can be envisioned to
   scale down the cost of state-of-the-art nonperturbative many-body
   methods in order to extend ab initio studies to (i) higher precisions,
   (ii) larger masses, and (iii) nuclei of doubly open-shell character.}},

Title = {{Comparing the accuracy of perturbative and variational calculations for
   predicting fundamental vibrational frequencies of dihalomethanes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Three dihalogenated methane derivatives (CH2F2, CH2FCl, and CH2Cl2) were
   used as model systems to compare and assess the accuracy of two
   different approaches for predicting observed fundamental frequencies:
   canonical operator Van Vleck vibrational perturbation theory (CVPT) and
   vibrational configuration interaction (VCI). For convenience and
   consistency, both methods employ the Watson Hamiltonian in rectilinear
   normal coordinates, expanding the potential energy surface (PES) as a
   Taylor series about equilibrium and constructing the wavefunction from a
   harmonic oscillator product basis. At the highest levels of theory
   considered here, fourth-order CVPT and VCI in a harmonic oscillator
   basis with up to 10 quanta of vibrational excitation in conjunction with
   a 4-mode representation sextic force field (SFF-4MR) computed at
   MP2/cc-pVTZ with replacement CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ harmonic force
   constants, the agreement between computed fundamentals is closer to 0.3
   cm(-1) on average, with a maximum difference of 1.7 cm(-1). The major
   remaining accuracy-limiting factors are the accuracy of the underlying
   electronic structure model, followed by the incompleteness of the PES
   expansion. Nonetheless, computed and experimental fundamentals agree to
   within 5 cm(-1), with an average difference of 2 cm(-1), confirming the
   utility and accuracy of both theoretical models. One exception to this
   rule is the formally IR-inactive but weakly allowed through
   Coriolis-coupling H-C-Hout-of-plane twisting mode of dichloromethane,
   whose spectrum we therefore revisit and reassign. We also investigate
   convergence with respect to order of CVPT, VCI excitation level, and
   order of PES expansion, concluding that premature truncation
   substantially decreases accuracy, although VCI(6)/SFF-4MR results are
   still of acceptable accuracy, and some error cancellation is observed
   with CVPT2 using a quartic force field. Published by AIP Publishing.}},
