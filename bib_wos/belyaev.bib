Title = {{CT-Based COVID-19 triage: Deep multitask learning improves joint
   identification and severity quantification}},

Abstract = {{The current COVID-19 pandemic overloads healthcare systems, including
   radiology departments. Though several deep learning approaches were
   developed to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage
   directly as a computer science problem. We describe two basic setups:
   Identification of COVID-19 to prioritize studies of potentially infected
   patients to isolate them as early as possible; Severity quantification
   to highlight patients with severe COVID-19, thus direct them to a
   hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these tasks as
   binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage. Though
   similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing
   methods could provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups.
   We employ a multitask approach to consolidate both triage approaches and
   propose a convolutional neural network to leverage all available labels
   within a single model. In contrast with the related multitask
   approaches, we show the benefit from applying the classification layers
   to the most spatially detailed feature map at the upper part of U-Net
   instead of the less detailed latent representation at the bottom. We
   train our model on approximately 1500 publicly available CT studies and
   test it on the holdout dataset that consists of 123 chest CT studies of
   patients drawn from the same healthcare system, specifically 32 COVID-19
   and 30 bacterial pneumonia cases, 30 cases with cancerous nodules, and
   31 healthy controls. The proposed multitask model outperforms the other
   approaches and achieves ROC AUC scores of 0 . 87 +/- 0 . 01 vs.
   bacterial pneumonia, 0 . 93 +/- 0 . 01 vs. cancerous nodules, and 0 . 97
   +/- 0 . 01 vs. healthy controls in Identification of COVID-19, and
   achieves 0 . 97 +/- 0 . 01 Spearman Correlation in Severity
   quantification . We have released our code and shared the annotated
   lesions masks for 32 CT images of patients with COVID-19 from the test
   dataset.\& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

Abstract = {{The prevailing approach for three-dimensional (3D) medical image
   segmentation is to use convolutional networks. Recently, deep learning
   methods have achieved human-level performance in several important
   applied problems, such as volumetry for lung-cancer diagnosis or
   delineation for radiation therapy planning. However, state-of-the-art
   architectures, such as U-Net and DeepMedic, are computationally heavy
   and require workstations accelerated with graphics processing units for
   fast inference. However, scarce research has been conducted concerning
   enabling fast central processing unit computations for such networks.
   Our paper fills this gap. We propose a new segmentation method with a
   human-like technique to segment a 3D study. First, we analyze the image
   at a small scale to identify areas of interest and then process only
   relevant feature-map patches. Our method not only reduces the inference
   time from 10 min to 15 s but also preserves state-of-the-art
   segmentation quality, as we illustrate in the set of experiments with
   two large datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Recent Metal Artifacts Reduction (MAR) methods for Computed Tomography
   are often based on image-to-image convolutional neural networks for
   adjustment of corrupted sinograms or images themselves. In this paper,
   we are exploring the capabilities of a multidomain method, which
   consists of both sinogram correction (projection domain step) and
   restored image correction (image-domain step). We formulate the first
   step problem directly as sinogram inpainting, which allows us to use
   methods of this specific field, such as partial convolutions. Moreover,
   we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline to avoid problems with
   overfitting to metal shapes set and an artifacts formation technique.
   The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (-75\% MSE) improvement in
   comparison with a classic benchmark - Li-MAR.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of
   presumed vascular origin is of key importance in many neurological
   research studies. Currently, measurements are often still obtained from
   manual segmentations on brain MR images, which is a laborious procedure.
   The automatic WMH segmentation methods exist, but a standardized
   comparison of the performance of such methods is lacking. We organized a
   scientific challenge, in which developers could evaluate their methods
   on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset, giving an
   objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge. Sixty T1 FLAIR
   images from three MR scanners were released with the manual WMH
   segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR
   scanners was used for evaluation. The segmentation methods had to be
   containerized and submitted to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation
   metrics were used to rank the methods: 1) Dice similarity coefficient;
   2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th percentile); 3) absolute
   log-transformed volume difference; 4) sensitivity for detecting
   individual lesions; and 5) F1-score for individual lesions. In addition,
   the methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness; 20
   participants submitted their methods for evaluation. This paper provides
   a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of four
   methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one
   clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all
   the methods generalize to unseen scanners. The challenge remains open
   for future submissions and provides a public platform for method
   evaluation.}},

Title = {{ISLES 2016 and 2017-Benchmarking Ischemic Stroke Lesion Outcome
   Prediction Based on Multispectral MRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Performance of models highly depend not only on the used algorithm but
   also the data set it was applied to. This makes the comparison of newly
   developed tools to previously published approaches difficult. Either
   researchers need to implement others' algorithms first, to establish an
   adequate benchmark on their data, or a direct comparison of new and old
   techniques is infeasible. The Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation
   (ISLES) challenge, which has ran now consecutively for 3 years, aims to
   address this problem of comparability. ISLES 2016 and 2017 focused on
   lesion outcome prediction after ischemic stroke: By providing a
   uniformly pre-processed data set, researchers from all over the world
   could apply their algorithm directly. A total of nine teams participated
   in ISLES 2015, and 15 teams participated in ISLES 2016. Their
   performance was evaluated in a fair and transparent way to identify the
   state-of-the-art among all submissions. Top ranked teams almost always
   employed deep learning tools, which were predominately convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs). Despite the great efforts, lesion outcome
   prediction persists challenging. The annotated data set remains publicly
   available and new approaches can be compared directly via the online
   evaluation system, serving as a continuing benchmark
   (www.isles-challenge.org).}},

Abstract = {{Datasets for medical image segmentation usually contain a very limited
   number of training examples. However, deep learning methods prove to be
   very competitive for such data analysis problems. Surprisingly, quite
   limited data augmentation is used during training. We presume that it's
   due to historical reasons: standardization and normalization of medical
   images dominate over methods for increasing the size of a training set
   by artificial transformation of images. We assume that it is partly
   caused by the absence of methods which preserve properties of adequately
   preprocessed medical images. In this paper, we propose a new method for
   brain MRI augmentation, which allows us to map a lesion from an original
   image to a healthy brain. We compare the performance of U-Net and
   DeepMedic, two popular deep learning architectures, using the proposed
   method, a set of classical image augmentation methods, and a combination
   of both approaches. Our results suggest that at least one of the
   individual strategies, as well as their combination, provide an increase
   in accuracy of brain lesions segmentation if the training sample is
   relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning methods are actively used for brain lesion segmentation.
   One of the most popular models is DeepMedic, which was developed for
   segmentation of relatively large lesions like glioma and ischemic
   stroke. In our work, we consider segmentation of brain tumors
   appropriate to stereotactic radiosurgery which limits typical lesion
   sizes. These differences in target volumes lead to a large number of
   false negatives (especially for small lesions) as well as to an
   increased number of false positives for DeepMedic. We propose a new
   patch-sampling procedure to increase network performance for small
   lesions. We used a 6-year dataset from a stereotactic radiosurgery
   center. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments with the
   three most frequent brain tumors: metastasis, meningioma, schwannoma. In
   addition to cross-validation, we estimated quality on a hold-out test
   set which was collected several years later than the train one. The
   experimental results show solid improvements in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years, neural networks have proven to be a powerful
   framework for various image analysis problems. However, some application
   domains have specific limitations. Notably, digital pathology is an
   example of such fields due to tremendous image sizes and quite limited
   number of training examples available. In this paper, we adopt
   state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures for
   digital pathology images analysis. We propose to classify image patches
   to increase effective sample size and then to apply an ensembling
   technique to build prediction for the original images. To validate the
   developed approaches, we conducted experiments with Breast Cancer
   Histology Challenge dataset and obtained 90\% accuracy for the 4-class
   tissue classification task.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years there have been a number of studies that applied
   deep learning algorithms to neuroimaging data. Pipelines used in those
   studies mostly require multiple processing steps for feature extraction,
   although modern advancements in deep learning for image classification
   can provide a powerful framework for automatic feature generation and
   more straightforward analysis. In this paper, we show how similar
   performance can be achieved skipping these feature extraction steps with
   the residual and plain 3D convolutional neural network architectures. We
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach for classification
   of Alzheimer's disease versus mild cognitive impairment and normal
   controls on the Alzheimers Disease National Initiative (ADNI) dataset of
