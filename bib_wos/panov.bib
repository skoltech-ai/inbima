Abstract = {{Here we report an approach to design composite cathode based on TiOx
   nanotubes decorated with RuOx nanowhiskers for efficient hydrogen
   evolution. We tailor catalytic activity of the cathodes by adjustment of
   morphology of TiOx nanotubular support layer along with variation of
   RuOx loaded mass and assess its performance using electrochemical
   methods and wavelet analysis.
   The highest energy efficiency of hydrogen evolution is observed in 1 M
   H2SO4 electrolyte to be ca. 64\% at -10 mA/cm(2) for cathodes of the
   most developed area, i.e. smaller diameter of tubes, with enhanced RuOx
   loading. The efficiency is favored by detachment of small hydrogen
   bubbles what is revealed by wavelet analysis and is expressed in pure
   noise at wavelet spectrum. At increased current density, -50 or -100
   mA/cm(2), better efficiency of composite cathodes is supported by
   titania nanotubes of larger diameter due to an easier release of large
   hydrogen bubbles manifested in less periodic events appeared in the
   frequency region of 5-12 s at the spectra.
   We have shown that efficiency of the catalysts is determined by a
   pre-dominant type of hydrogen bubble release at different operation
   regimes depending on specific surface and a loaded mass of ruthenia. (C)

Abstract = {{Aerial drones can be used for a number of monitoring and control
   applications. Most of existing drone control platforms are quite
   primitive in terms of body-machine interface. They are usually a
   variation of a hand-held remote controller or ground control station.
   However, in a number of line-of-sight scenarios it would be more
   convenient to use the human gestures and voice for the drone control. In
   this work, we present an approach for instantaneous control of drones
   based on human voice and gestures. The proposed solution includes
   wearable sensors and embedded artificial intelligence. We use a
   microphone and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for capturing the
   human voice and the hand movements. Primary control is implemented by a
   voice recognition unit based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) while the
   secondary control is implemented by the gesture recognition system based
   on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For implementing the embedded
   intelligence, we use a low-power embedded system with a graphical
   processing unit able to run pre-trained neural networks on board of the
   drone. As a result, the system can perform different speech and gesture
   recognition tasks real-time.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of unsupervised learning node embeddings in graphs is one of
   the important directions in modern network science. In this work we
   propose a novel framework, which is aimed to find embeddings by
   discriminating distributions of similarities (DDoS) between nodes in the
   graph. The general idea is implemented by maximizing the earth mover
   distance between distributions of decoded similarities of similar and
   dissimilar nodes. The resulting algorithm generates embeddings which
   give a state-of-the-art performance in the problem of link prediction in
   real-world graphs.}},

Abstract = {{Bitcoin is digital assets infrastructure powering the first worldwide
   decentralized cryptocurrency of the same name. All history of Bitcoins
   owning and transferring (addresses and transactions) is available as a
   public ledger called blockchain. But real-world owners of addresses are
   not known in general. That's why Bitcoin is called pseudo-anonymous.
   However, some addresses can be grouped by their ownership using behavior
   patterns and publicly available information from off-chain sources.
   Blockchain-based common behavior pattern analysis (common spending and
   one-time change heuristics) is widely used for Bitcoin clustering as
   votes for addresses association, while off-chain information (tags) is
   mostly used to verify results. In this paper, we propose to use
   off-chain information as votes for address separation and to consider it
   together with blockchain information during the clustering model
   construction step. Both blockchain and off-chain information are not
   reliable, and our approach aims to filter out errors in input data.
   The results of the study show the feasibility of a proposed approached
   for Bitcoin address clustering. It can be useful for the users to avoid
   insecure Bitcoin usage patterns and for the investigators to conduct a
   more advanced de-anonymizing analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the regression problem, i.e. prediction of a real valued
   function. A Gaussian process prior is imposed on the function, and is
   combined with the training data to obtain predictions for new points. We
   introduce a Bayesian regularization on parameters of a covariance
   function of the process, which increases quality of approximation and
   robustness of the estimation. Also an approach to modeling nonstationary
   covariance function of a Gaussian process on basis of linear expansion
   in parametric functional dictionary is proposed. Introducing such a
   covariance function allows to model functions, which have
   non-homogeneous behaviour. Combining above features with careful
   optimization of covariance function parameters results in unified
   approach, which can be easily implemented and applied. The resulting
   algorithm is an out of the box solution to regression problems, with no
   need to tune parameters manually. The effectiveness of the method is
   demonstrated on various datasets.}},

Abstract = {{The classical semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) results is
   reconsidered in a non-classical setup allowing finite samples and model
   misspecication. We obtain an upper bound on the error of Gaussian
   approximation of the posterior distribution for the target parameter
   which is explicit in the dimension of the target parameter and in the
   dimension of sieve approximation of the nuisance parameter. This helps
   to identify the so called critical dimension p (n) of the sieve
   approximation of the full parameter for which the BvM result is
   applicable. If the bias induced by sieve approximation is small and
   dimension of sieve approximation is smaller then critical dimension than
   the BvM result is valid. In the important i.i.d. and regression cases,
   we show that the condition ``p (n) (2) q/n is small{''}, where q is the
   dimension of the target parameter and n is the sample size, leads to the
   BvM result under general assumptions on the model.}},

Abstract = {{The classical parametric and semiparametric Bernstein - von Mises (BvM)
   results are reconsidered in a non-classical setup allowing finite
   samples and model misspecification. In the case of a finite dimensional
   nuisance parameter we obtain an upper bound on the error of Gaussian
   approximation of the posterior distribution for the target parameter
   which is explicit in the dimension of the nuisance and target
   parameters. This helps to identify the so called critical dimension p(n)
   of the full parameter for which the BvM result is applicable. In the
   important i.i.d. case, we show that the condition ``p(n)(3)/n is
   small{''} is sufficient for the BvM result to be valid under general
   assumptions on the model. We also provide an example of a model with the
   phase transition effect: the statement of the BvM theorem fails when the
   dimension p(n) approaches n(1/3). The results are extended to the case
   of infinite dimensional parameters with the nuisance parameter from a
   Sobolev class.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly the case in multi-modal pattern recognition that certain
   modality-specific object features are missing in the training set. We
   address here the missing data problem for kernel-based Support Vector
   Machines, in which each modality is represented by the respective kernel
   matrix over the set of training objects, such that the omission of a
   modality for some object manifests itself as a blank in the
   modality-specific kernel matrix at the relevant position. We propose to
   fill the blank positions in the collection of training kernel matrices
   via a variant of the Neutral Point Substitution (NPS) method, where the
   term ``neutral point{''} stands for the locus of points defined by the
   ``neutral hyperplane{''} in the hypothetical linear space produced by
   the respective kernel. The current method crucially differs from the
   previously developed neutral point approach in that it is capable of
   treating missing data in the training set on the same basis as missing
   data in the test set. It is therefore of potentially much wider
   applicability. We evaluate the method on the Biosecure DS2 data set.}},
